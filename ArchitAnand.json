If you‚Äôve ever been burned by an agency that overpromised and underdelivered, now‚Äôs the time to share your story. Let‚Äôs create a¬†reference list of agencies to avoid¬†so businesses can make better decisions.\nHere‚Äôs what happened in just¬†two weeks¬†of working with them:\n‚ùå The founder dismissed repeated concerns, telling us to ‚Äúhave faith.‚Äù\n‚ùå Work was blindly delegated to junior staff with no real understanding of our business.\n‚ùå Despite multiple training sessions, they kept using messaging we explicitly rejected.\n‚ùå No flexibility, no accountability‚Äîjust delays and excuses.\n‚ùå When asked for a refund, they ghosted, stretched timelines, and disregarded SLAs.\n‚ùå After barely two weeks of poor work (1 static post + 1 story), they claimed they spent¬†45 days¬†on our account and offered¬†only 20% back‚Äîat some future date, if their accounting team allowed it.\nThis isn‚Äôt just my story. I know¬†many brands¬†have faced the same struggles. Let‚Äôs¬†call them out.¬†If we get¬†10 people¬†to share their horror stories, I‚Äôll name the agency here.\nüëá Drop your experiences in the comments. Tag others who should see this.

  "text": "As a 2-times $1M founder, \n\nThese are the 5 Things I Wish I'd Known Sooner:\n\nüéØ Nobody Cares About Your Cool Solution\nLet's be honest - I spent way too long being excited about features nobody asked for. People don't buy \"nice-to-haves\" - they buy \"need-to-haves\" that make their problems go away. How painful is the problem that you are solving?\n\nüîç Get Picky About Who You Serve\nI wasted months marketing to the wrong audience and burned cash and time through the process before getting it right. Find your ICP and refine it relentlessly until it's laser-precise. Don't even think about running ads until you've nailed exactly who you're talking to and confirmed they actually want what you're selling.\n\nüå± Fish Where The Fish Are Biting\nLook, some prospects are ready to buy now, and some will never be ready. I wasted so much time on the wrong people! Focus on high-intent channels where you can grab the low-hanging fruit. One good customer who's ready to buy beats ten who \"might be interested someday.\"\n\n‚è±Ô∏è Your Time Is Worth More Than You Think\nThis was a game-changer for me: before jumping into any task, I ask myself, \"Can I automate this? Can someone else do this?\" If you're doing $10/hour work when you could be doing $1,000/hour work, you're leaving money on the table.\n\nü§ñ AI Won't Save You (But It Can Help)\nI got caught up in the AI hype too, buying tools I barely used, it‚Äôs not the answer to every question. Use AI to automate workflows and manual work to make more of your time. That's how I started building Fuelgrowth - to strike that balance. We use AI to get deep insights impossible for us to derive and to make efficient workflows, but we know it's the human touch that really makes marketing work. No robot can replace good content.\n\nOn a side note do you want to see what you're missing? My team is planning to offer a FREE Performance Review to a few companies that reach out to us. We combine AI insights with human expertise to analyse everything from details as minute as audio choices to even your influencer selection. We'll show you exactly how to make every marketing dollar count. Comment ‚ÄòSUPERADS‚Äô below or connect with me for a conversation\n\nHave a Good day!üòä\n\n#StartupLessons #GrowthHacking #ProductMarketFit #FounderJourney  #StartupTips #MarketingStrategy #BusinessGrowth #EntrepreneurMindset",

  "text": "In the last few months of building Fuelgrowth, we have spoken with countless founders and marketing teams from startups to scale-ups and agencies who claim to be the best in class, most of them are today not happy with their paid media game and the return they are getting on the time and money invested, Its a make or break for all these businesses. \n\nMy observations on why they and many more like them continue to struggle in the toxic cycles of changing performance marketing agencies without really seeing any meaningful improvement \n\n1) Lack of understanding of the latest changes on Meta and TikTok ads and how they really work today. \n\n2) Most of these brands and agencies have no creative testing frameworks in place. \n\n3) Not leveraging AI and the latest technology and most importantly not being open to the opportunities it creates for them. \n\nThese are unfortunately holding back a lot of these businesses. We have decided to share our learnings at Fuelgrowth in public and help operators/ business owners, watch this space and a public release soon!  \n\n#AIInMarketing #PerformanceMarketing #DTC #Contentledgrowth \n\nArchit Agrawal Varun Chopra Fanshen Chan Greta Remington",

  "text": "Late Post! I was in Manila in September where I was invited to speak about \"AI beauty revolution\" by the Chamber of cosmetics industry in the Philippines. The Panel had a great mix of legal, data science and AI research experts. \n\nThe discussion ranged from data security concerns, vertical AI use-cases for businesses, legal implications from widespread AI use and put simply how do we get started with incorporating AI in our day to day activities at work. \n\nFew takeaways from the discussion : \n1) Be open to adopting AI in your workflows to stay ahead of the market, look at what your global counterparts are doing or what your local competitors are doing and keep an open mind about the potential. \n2) Start small with AI use them for your daily communications with the customer, customer support automation,  employee knowledge centres and process automations. \n3) Keep an eye on the public and government policies on AI and how they evolve with time but don't let that slow your AI adoption. \n4) Incentivise and encourage your employees to use AI for daily tasks rather than making it a barrier, open up strategic roles to use AI and certain roles where there are confidential data keep strict policies to avoid data leaks. \n5) Various AI applications in providing a personalised experience to consumers at every touchpoint from Social media to website checkout to support.\n\nOver all it was so encouraging to see so many successful entrepreneurs still looking to learn, evolve and keep pace with changing times. \n\nMany thanks to the fellow panelists who shared great insights and knowledge Guita Gopalan Alex Austria Kyle Patrick Bartido Ralph Vincent Regalado and to Diego Buenaflor for putting this together.",

  "text": "Controversial View - Majority of the DTC brands in India are playing a losing game ‚ö° \n\nSimply put here is why ? They have not yet adjusted their performance strategies or come to terms with the changes that Meta has introduced. \n\nUnfortunately agencies and marketing fraternity is playing catchup with the best practices in the west and that has hugely impacted the growth story of wider DTC in India.  We are yet again slow in accepting changes, unlearning and relearning which also highlights the difference in the quality of talent. \n\nThe ecosystem is scratching their heads as to why are brands not growing at the same pace as in the past ? Yes certain macro level game has changed, more competition for every product and category, the space is crowded but isn't that how every space/market evolves ? \n\nOn the contrary - the ones who have really been agile, shifted focus to content/creatives, story telling and brand building are reaping benefits. Those who have not shied away from trying new partners/tools, re-building teams and organisation with skills which are needed.  \n\nThis might be because India was never exposed to TikTok Shop to begin with and brands here didn't see the impact it has had globally where marketplaces and Meta and Shopify have all been to put it mildly losing sleep. \n\nWe live in an attention deficit world and every business today has to be a media  or a content creation house. Which brands according to you have been doing well with their creatives/content game ? \n\n#DTC #ecommerce #Content #Creatives #PerformanceMarketing #Shopify #Meta #Tiktok",

  "text": "Over the past few weeks, the team at Fuelgrowth has been heads-down, laser-focused on execution, customer obsession, and building serious momentum.\n\nüåç As a founder building in the generative AI space across Asia, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to meet customers, partners, and investors across Singapore, Delhi NCR, and Bangalore. These conversations have provided valuable insights, and I wanted to share a few key patterns we‚Äôve observed in the market:\n\n1. Early AI adopters are wary:\nMany early adopters have faced challenges in realizing the promised value of AI. This has created skepticism, as tools haven‚Äôt consistently outperformed human capabilities across job functions. üö´\n\n2. Unrealistic expectations slow adoption:\nBuyers often expect AI to deliver end-to-end solutions, without requiring incremental user input. This mindset has delayed AI adoption, as stakeholders hesitate to engage with tools that still require human involvement. üîÑ\n\n3. Enterprises are stuck in pilot mode:\nWhile internal mandates for AI-driven cost optimization and growth exist, internal champions lack conviction. Many enterprises remain in the pilot phase, waiting for proven use cases before fully committing. ‚è≥\n\n4. Midmarket and growth-oriented firms lead the way:\nThere‚Äôs a silver lining: midmarket and fast-growing companies are actively experimenting with AI use cases. These early adopters are willing to be patient, collaborate, and become your initial champions. For founders like myself, these are the partnerships that fuel early-stage growth. üí°\n\n5. Offering ‚ÄúAI Outcomes as a Service‚Äù may be the answer:\nAnother path is positioning yourself as an agency, offering ‚Äúoutcome as a service‚Äù by using your product to automate internal processes and building case studies that showcase profitable results. This can help reduce the risk/reward ratio for clients and accelerate market adoption. üìà\n\nThe generative AI space is full of opportunity, but founders need to be strategic about how they approach the market. I‚Äôm eager to connect with fellow founders, investors, and enablers who are passionate about shaping the future of AI.\nLet‚Äôs build together! ü§ù #AI #GenerativeAI #Entrepreneurship #Tech #Startup #AsiaTech #Innovation #Growth",

  "text": "Static Ads Are Making a Comeback!\n\nYes, you heard me right.\n\nOver the past three months, collaborating with various brands and agencies has revealed an intriguing insight that challenges the current market playbooks.\n\nOur data and performance analysis comparing UGC reels and static ads clearly show a winner.\n\nIf you're a brand looking to leverage social media platforms to boost engagement across your funnel, static creatives must be part of your content strategy. Here are three compelling reasons why:\n\nReel Fatigue: Attention spans are dwindling, and users are becoming more selective about the content they consume. Static ads offer a refreshing change.\n\nCost and Authenticity Issues with UGC: User-generated content is becoming\nincreasingly expensive. Users are savvy and can spot a sales pitch a mile away. Brands need to push more authentic data through UGC to stand out.\n\nMessage Clarity: Static ads allow brands to convey their message quickly and clearly as users scroll. Well-designed static ads, when intelligently positioned and targeted, drive better results.\n\nAnd the most crucial reason:\n\nEfficiency in Performance Marketing: Today's performance marketing thrives on rapid iterations and A/B testing. Static ads are cheaper and quicker to produce, allowing performance marketers to experiment more freely and optimize data-backed campaigns for better outcomes.\n\nIf you're a marketer, brand owner, content/brand head, or P&L owner, and this resonates with you‚Äîor if you have contrarian views‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to hear from you.\n\n#Content #PerformanceMarketing #AI #DTC #Growth",

  "text": "üöÄ Excited to share my thoughts on the future of tech, especially in Asia and India! üåèüí°\n\nFor the past six years, I've been immersed in building tech solutions first in SEA and now globally from India. And let me tell you, I've never been more thrilled about what lies ahead!\n\nüåü Historically, we've often tried to mimic the successes of our Western counterparts without truly understanding our local dynamics and habits. Many esteemed founders with substantial venture backing have experimented with different models, yet faced strong resistance or opted for alternative paths.\n\nüíº The challenge? Achieving widespread adoption and monetization, particularly for tech ventures targeting SMEs and mid-market segments in this region.\n\nüåê Fast forward to today, and I see a persistent trend: we're still looking westward for inspiration rather than honing in on what truly resonates locally and can scale globally.\n\nüîÆ Enter AI Agents ‚Äî a game-changer poised to revolutionize this approach.\n\nü§ñ AI Agents, far from being mere buzzwords, represent a seismic shift in how we approach problem-solving. They're not just fancy wrappers atop GenAI models; they're tailored solutions designed to bridge the last mile across diverse markets.\n\nüîç Why am I bullish? Here's the scoop:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ AI agents will democratize access to specialized skill sets for SMEs and mid-market companies, leveling the playing field. No more settling for mediocre talent; now, businesses can tap into top-tier expertise seamlessly, enhancing their capabilities and outcomes.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ With resources freed up, companies can focus on their core expertise, driving improvements in quality and consumer experiences. This will empower aspirational companies in Asia to compete globally on a whole new level.\n\nüå± As we embrace the age of AI agents, builders in Asia have an unprecedented opportunity to create value locally and scale globally. Early adopters and users are closer than ever, offering a level playing field for innovation and growth.\n\nExciting times lie ahead, and I can't wait to be part of this transformative journey! üíº‚ú® #TechInnovation #AI #AsiaTech #FutureOfTech",

  "text": "üî• Excited to share my Monday pick with you all! üé®‚ú® We've been crafting some amazing creatives using Fuego - the AI creative designer by Fuelgrowth, and the results have been phenomenal!\n\n\nüí° Many brands we collaborate with are eager to disrupt the status quo dominated by traditional giants. Crafting clever creatives to showcase their product superiority and educate their audience is paramount.\n\nüöÄ When we engage with DTC founders or agency partners, our first focus is on pinpointing the messaging that truly resonates with the product they're about to market. Once we capture that emotional connection, it's all about sparking the desired reaction or action.\n\nüí¨ While A/B testing creatives is crucial, sometimes simplicity speaks volumes. It's essential to explore formats that are easy to digest, understand, and resonate with consumers right where it matters.\n\nüîç Take, for instance, a comparison creative Fuego developed for a razor brand challenging the titan, Gillette. It's concise, compelling, and effortlessly communicates why consumers should opt for them over Gillette.\n\nüìà If your brand is struggling to see returns on statics or lacks a cohesive strategy to leverage static creatives effectively, I'm here to help! For the next four weeks, I'm offering 10 complimentary 60-minute consultation to brands & agencies. Let's craft a 3-month plan to elevate your key marketing metrics and boost your ROAS. \n\nReach out via DMs for access to my calendly and let's get started! üí¨üíº #MarketingStrategy #Creativity #ROI #ConsultationOffer",

They serve as powerful symbols, evoking not only the sensation of odor but also triggering memories and emotions associated with unpleasant smells. üå¨Ô∏èüí°\n\nThrough this clever manipulation of visual cues, Febreze subtly communicates its message of odor elimination without uttering a single word.\n\nThis ingenious utilization of semiotics underscores the profound impact that visual stimuli can have on brand perception. üí≠‚ú®\n\nBy tapping into our subconscious associations, advertisers can craft narratives that resonate deeply with consumers.\n\nLet's infuse some semiotic magic into your advertising strategy.

  "text": "üöÄ What a Blast at the Heroes of DTC Singapore Meetup! üöÄ\n\nWow, just wow! We wrapped up our exclusive gathering in Singapore, and I'm still buzzing from the energy and insights shared. A heartfelt thank you to the vibrant Singapore community for showing so much love and support. üôè\n\nWe had the pleasure of welcoming over 70 passionate DTC founders, executives, influencers, and investors who are shaping the future of e-commerce. From deep dives into consumer habits post-COVID to exploring the seismic shifts in the e-commerce landscape for 2024, the discussions were nothing short of enlightening. The networking was top-notch, and the fireside chats? Pure gold.\n\nA special shoutout to our incredible speakers - Hardik Batra (foodpanda), Piet Coelewij (Amazon), Namra Nillove Deka (Shopify) discussing DTC strategies, to Percy Hung (Choco Up), Priyanka Mahulkar (Gram Circle AI), Matthew McClelland (Dotdigital)  insights on e-commerce growth, and investor perspectives from Sameer Mehta (DSG Consumer Partners), Mark Sng (Gentree Fund) and Kuldeep Mirani (BeyondSeed) - each conversation sparked new ideas and left us inspired.\n\nAlso, a very special thanks to our sponsors Amazon, Amazon Business and Fuelgrowth for making this event possible. Looking forward to more such initiatives to bring the ecosystem together and scale to new heights. Aubrey X, Saptarshi Nath and Kaustubh Wadhwa, you guys were a great help and made the event a tremendous success.\n\nWant to be a part the Heroes of DTC community as we add more city chapters, RSVP on the link in comments",

  "text": "I am glad to share the launch of Heroes of DTC - A private and curated community of DTC founders. \n\nI have been part of the APAC eCommerce ecosystem since 2016, seen it grow first hand and have met 1000s of crazy founders building with the dream to become the next big brand but there are very few local heroes they could speak or look upto. \n\nWith this, I want to bring all the DTC heroes together at one place to share knowledge, support and grow together. We‚Äôre bringing mentors, advisors, tech partners, investors, etc. to help founders along your journey and build SEA's first community tailored for local needs.\n\nI am personally thrilled to bring this to life finally and it is an amalgamation of my 8+ years in the industry, with this community our aim is to build a seed to IPO/Exit playbook for DTC brands. \n\nLink to register : https://lnkd.in/dvFhMK9G \n\nPlease comment interested or mention someone relevant and I‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre part of it. :D\n\n#community #dtcbrands #southeastasia #founderstories",

  "text": "As the world is still digesting all the updates Sam Altman announced earlier this week https://lnkd.in/gCZarrKc.  \n\nHere are some of my initial thoughts : \n\n‚≠ê Wrappers on top of chatGPT with horizontal usecases and no data moat will all be eaten up by OpenAI eventually. All these usecases will eventually have a single interface that is chatGPT. \n\n‚≠ê Infrastructure and guardrails are safe and is still a good space to build in but based on what I have seen in the last 3-4 months everyone who initially wanted to build LLMs at the start of the year is now building the Infra layer - unless you can distribute and scale fast the space is heating up super quick. \n\n‚≠ê Vertical AI usecases with deep expertise and data moats will have winners faster than the infra layers which is waiting for winners to evolve in this space. If you peel few layers there are diamonds to unearth here and clear differentiations to build similar to how people have built products on Shopify app stores and other platforms, we will see big moves and winners in this space. \n\n‚≠ê OpenAI Appstore is a game changer and will only increase AI adoption incrementally. It will be a key distribution channel for AI apps moving forward. \n\nIf you are not building in AI today, it still early days and not too late. AI is changing how humans work fundamentally and job descriptions in the near future will look very different! \n\nWhat are your takeaways and thoughts on what's next ? Does this change your AI strategy ? \n\n#ai #openai #chatgpt #gpt #openaidevday",

  "text": "My interactions with DTC/agency operators and founders over the last 1 year has thrown light on some interesting observations on the what is happening in the DTC market. \n\n1)  There is very little differentiation on product these days hence competition for keywords is huge. \n2) ROAS  has been going down while CAC is increasing leading to brands and agencies fight it out to retain their market share instead of growing. \n3) Profitability at very early stages of brand building is now the norm which is also a pressure point for marketers and agencies.  Reasons : lesser venture money to burn and current market sentiments. \n4) Gone are the days where you could rely on performance marketing to be a differentiator. Every DTC brand has access to an agency/operator who knows performance marketing and there is very little moat here. \n5) Creatives is where the differentiation lies today. Every DTC brand is a now a content creation or a story telling house. The budgets for and Qty of creatives being churned out is increasing every day. \n\nKey learnings - Measure your creatives performances closely, automating your creative and performance marketing workflows will help brands reduce CAC and also improve ROAS. \n\nIf you are a DTC founder, enabler or agency operator,  I would love to hear your thoughts on how you are navigating today's climate while building brands. \n\n\n#dtcmarketing #creative #contentmarketing #performancemarketing #dtcbrands",
