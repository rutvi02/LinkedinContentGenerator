  "text": "We’ve raised over $35M, crossed $5M ARR, generated billions of organic impressions - and still have zero people on our internal marketing team\n\nThat’s not because marketing isn’t a priority. If you’ve seen our billboards or AI CEO, you know we take brand awareness very seriously...\n\nWe’ve just been deliberate about staying lean. While we’ve hired aggressively across product and engineering, marketing is the one function we’ve chosen to scale differently - all campaigns are managed by me and Tina Sang\n\nOur marketing approach is to:\n- Stick to activities which leverage our time as much as possible\n- Leverage AI and automation as much as possible\n- Avoid wasting time on bureaucracy\n- Ruthlessly prioritize with quarterly marketing strategies\n- Rely on expert freelancers for specific functions like SEO, paid, content, video, animation & much more. We couldn’t achieve what we have without them\n\nA bloated internal marketing team drains creativity and slows you down\n\nThat being said, we're at capacity and we’re ready to finally make our first marketing hire! If you want to help us brainstorm crazy billboard slogans or our next viral campaign, apply here: artisan.co/careers\n\nAnd if you need a AI BDR to keep your marketing team lean, hire Ava here: artisan.co/talk-to-sales",

  "text": "We raised our $25M Series A just 6 months after our seed. Here are the four reasons why:\n\n1. The market is moving fast. A lot of new players are entering and we need to ship amazing products fast if we want to win\n\n2. We want to maintain our really strong momentum. A lot of startups lose their momentum and their velocity platesus if they sit in one funding stage for too long. Raising keeps the team excited, opens doors with bigger customers and builds brand awareness\n\n3. We wanted to attract amazing talent (most senior leadership & great engineers don’t want to take a risk on a seed stage company)\n\n4. We know what we need to build, it’s just a matter of executing. And to build our ambitious roadmap, we needed more talented people on the team\n\nEvery startup has its own pace. For Artisan, it’s moving relentlessly fast because we know we have an opportunity here and we don’t want to miss it \n\nFor some, building a company bootstrapped is the right path. If you want to maintain full control of your company, choose your own pace and take dividends, don’t raise money. If you want to move extremely fast and build a generational company, raise at a regular cadence\n\nAnd if you want to join us, apply here: artisan.co/careers\n\nOr hire our AI BDR Ava (who works even faster than us 😉) then get in touch: artisan.co/talk-to-sales",

  "text": "After announcing our $25M Series A last week, I'm excited to share that we are launching V3 of Artisan\n\nThis release brings us closer to what outbound should be: one consolidated AI-native platform that’s intent-driven and actually effective\n\nMost teams today juggle 5+ tools just to run basic outreach. It’s clunky and outdated. Our AI BDR Ava watches the market, identifies intent signals, and acts in real time\n\nHere’s what’s new in V3:\n\nData miner - Ava scrapes 100s of sources (firmographic, technographic, intent) to pull rich lead data\n\nPersonalization waterfall - Ava dynamically identifies the best personalization on a lead level\n\nWatchtower campaigns - Ava monitors intent signals across the internet and launches outreach the moment a lead shows buying intent (this is being rolled out with more and more triggers over the next few months)\n\nOutbound is evolving. And we’re building the system that leads the shift\n\nLearn more about Ava: artisan.co/talk-to-sales\n\nWhile this is exciting for us, I'm beyond excited to share what V4 looks like - there's truly nothing like it on the market. It's already in the works and will be launching in Q3",

  "text": "When Artisan launched its audacious “Stop Hiring Humans” billboard campaign across San Francisco, it didn’t just catch eyes — it ignited a firestorm. Designed to stand out in a sea of tech jargon, the intentionally provocative message positioned Artisan’s AI SDR, Ava, as the future of sales development. What started with a single misspelled billboard (“Stop Hirring Humans”) quickly snowballed into viral outrage, 35,000 Reddit, Inc. upvotes, media frenzy, and even death threats.\n\nDespite the backlash, Artisan doubled down on the controversy, with CEO Jaspar Carmichael-Jack posting the campaign on r/mildlyinfuriating, sparking millions of impressions. “We wanted to draw eyes and spark interest... while driving a bit of rage with the wider public,” Jaspar admitted. Their strategy worked — Artisan was soon flooded with sales meetings, made headlines in top media houses and saw over $2M in new ARR.\n\nBeyond the noise, the campaign paid off — Artisan is now one of the fastest-growing AI companies by brand search, per Ahrefs. “70% of the people I meet in San Francisco now know Artisan. Before it was 5%,” says Jaspar. Though the messaging stirred controversy, it struck gold with their actual audience: tech companies looking to automate grunt work, not replace humans entirely.\nIn the end, Artisan clarified: “The truth is, we love humans.” The mission isn’t dystopia — it’s about freeing humans from tedious tasks. Ava was built to take care of what people don’t want to do, not take their place. Bold, risky, and a little chaotic — Artisan’s campaign is a masterclass in standing out in tech’s loudest city.",

  "text": "Over the last few weeks, I’ve had many first year MBAs reach out asking how I landed my in-semester internship at Artisan. So here’s my blueprint:\n\n𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗯𝘆 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝘀\n- Before any outreach, I asked myself: Where do I want to be in 5–7 years?\n- My answer: Product x Vertical AI Agents. Even this broad vision helped me filter my search\n- The path may not always be linear, and that’s okay. But try to build towards where you want to be\n\n𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽𝘀 𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 PitchBook\n.. and apply filters that align with where you want to work\n- Sector fit → I focused on AI agents\n- Recent funding rounds (announced <6 months ago) → signals momentum and recruiting appetite\n- Round size (>$8M) → I leaned toward Seed and Series A startups that raised enough to offer a real runway and stability\n\n𝗦𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗲𝗱𝗜𝗻 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗹 𝗬𝗢𝗨\n- Everyone says “demonstrate where you can add value.” I found that… unproductive\n- Startups are chaotic! You’ll never guess what’s top of mind for them\n- So I focused on what I did know: my track record and my skills\n\n𝗔𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝗺𝗽𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗼𝗻 𝘂𝗻𝗽𝗮𝗶𝗱 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽𝘀\n- I have 5+ years of experience, and I value my time\n- But more than that, if your time has no defined value, you risk being handed low leverage / low value work\n- Tip for founders: I never had to chat about this with Jaspar Carmichael-Jack at Artisan. He led with a solid comp package - no posturing, no games! Told me so much about how he leads\n\nThere’s no one right way, but this worked for me!",

  "text": "I’m excited to announce that we’ve raised a $25M Series A at Artisan to make our AI BDR Ava even more effective and build 2 more AI Employees this year\n\nIt was great to sit down with Julie Bort from TechCrunch to talk about what’s next for Artisan. It's refreshing how strong of an understanding Julie and the TC team have of the space. You can read the article here: https://lnkd.in/ei3gecF9\n\nTwo years ago, I was building a company I wasn’t passionate about. I was always looking for what would be next, and felt unfulfilled\n\nI knew I wanted to build a truly impactful company, and when I had the idea for Artisan, I knew it could be exactly that. There is a paradigm shift taking place in software which we are betting everything on - the move from unintelligent sprawling SaaS to AI-first, consolidated products\n\nIt wasn’t smooth sailing to begin with, I was turned down by over 100 investors when I first started raising (to be fair, we didn’t have a product...)\n\nThen Oliver Jung took a bet on us and gave us our first check for $1.75M\n\nWe got into Y Combinator shortly after that, and it’s been an insane journey since then\n\nIn the past 12 months, we’ve:\n- Built Ava, the AI BDR - our flagship Artisan\n- Closed hundreds of customers\n- Reached $5M ARR\n- Gone viral with 1B+ online impressions on our “Stop Hiring Humans” shock marketing campaign\n- Hired an incredible team, including our new CTO Ming Li\n\nAnd we’re just getting started\n\nWe’re extremely excited to have Paul Hudson from Glade Brook Capital Partners LLC joining our board. Oliver introduced me to Paul last August and he, along with the wider Glade Brook team (Isabel Swope, Linda Guo), has been an invaluable resource to us. There’s nobody we’d rather be partnering with at this stage of our growth\n\nWe’re also grateful to Y Combinator for their reinvestment and continued support, and especially our group partner Pete Koomen who has been there day and night to help with whatever the issue of the hour is\n\nIn our roadmap for 2025, we’re launching:\n- Aaron the Inbound SDR Artisan \n- Aria the Meeting Assistant Artisan\n- + more to be announced\n\nThis round brings our total funding to over $35M. Thank you to every investor who has supported us: HubSpot Ventures, Masha Bucher and Tara Harandi-Zadeh from Day One Ventures, TriplePoint Capital, Fellows Fund, BOND, Sequoia Capital Scout, 10x Founders, Aneel Ranadive from Soma Capital, Olive Technology Ventures, CoreNest Capital, Mento vc, Anu Hariharan, Paul Daversa, David J. Phillips, Teddy Nwachuku, Lawrence Lin Murata, Alumni Ventures and others\n\nWe’re hiring for every role (except BDRs 😉) - come join us in SF or remote: https://lnkd.in/ePZACACq \n  \nIf you want to hire Ava: https://lnkd.in/eCJXPyhp \n\n(Oh, and our AI CEO decided I should post this one since he keeps on getting banned from LinkedIn for being a bot)",

  "text": "AI SDR's & All-In-One solutions have two huge advantages over tools like Clay.\n\nConvenience & Ease. 👇 \n\nWhile I'll always say you should use Clay & you shoul create your own tech stack to suit your own needs...\n\nThere is no denying that these all-in-one solutions are getting better everyday.\n\nHere's some examples:\n\na) Unify \n\nThey're making the most of AI Agents, and will also source all types of first & 3rd party signals for you.\n\nb) Common Room\n\nCommon Room replaces the need for Clay by sourcing intent data & performing deep prospect research you can use for your outbound campaigns.\n\nc) lemlist\n\nWhile not as powerful with finding signals, lemlist allows you to link your OpenAI key, allowing you to create AI Variables.\n\nWith their chrome extension you're also able to get some awesome data to feed to GPT.\n\nd) Instantly.ai\n\nWith Instantly.ai will set-up your email infrastructure, meaning you can use their tool to identify you website vistors & outreach all in one place. (Plus they even have a CRM.)\n\ne) Artisan\n\nNow the most unique example is Artisan, where they'll do everything from beginning to end. From hunting for signals, sourcing prospects, crafting campaigns, and outreaching.\n\n... Let's pause for a second, because while I'd still say you can use Clay and just a couple other tools to also achieve the same thing.\n\nYou can't deny the convenience of all-in-one platforms, and with the rate they're advancing at...\n\nIt's not completely out of the realm to say they might overtake tools such as Clay, through ease of use alone.\n\nWhile I still think we're quite far from that point, I also don't think we're too far from this being reality. 👀 \n\nWhat's your thoughts on AI SDR's and All-In-One platforms?\n\nP.S. We're running a Webinar with Unify @ 5 PM CET today, if you have any thoughts about all-in-one platforms, feel free to join us live on Linkedin to discuss them with their CEO Austin Hughes directly. 😉",

  "text": "Some would call the culture at Artisan extreme. Employees have gotten tattoos of our logo (and more want to), some of us live in a house together, and everyone always goes above and beyond to support each other\n\nHere are a few ways we've built morale within the company that have worked really well:\n\n1. Fun channels in Slack where we can share shoutouts, memes & life updates\n2. Frequent offsites and in-person touchpoints with the team\n3. Celebrating every win - closed sales deals, customer compliments, feature launches, etc\n4. Flying people to our hacker house in SF to live and work with us\n\nJust in the past 3 months, we've hosted a PDE offsite in Bali, GTM offsite in Tulum, and flown 2 of our new joiners to our hacker house in SF to live and work with us for an extended period\n\nI constantly get messages from sales prospects, customers and vendors about how amazing our team are, and it puts a smile on my face every time\n\nEven though we work hard at Artisan, we also value having fun and making Artisan feel like a place you'd want to work for the next 10 years!\n\nBig things are coming - we're doing a huge push and releasing the next iteration of Ava, our AI BDR over the next 4 months. Ava 4.0 will do outbound in the most intelligent, human, tactical and strategic way of any outbound product on the market\n\nWe're hiring.

  "text": "Excited to share that I’ve joined Artisan as CTO! 🚀\n\nI first connected with Jaspar Carmichael-Jack last November when he reached out to me on LinkedIn. Within minutes of our first call, I knew Artisan was a unique company with an ambitious vision for the future of software.\n\nAfter getting to know Jaspar, Sam Stallings, and the Artisan team over the past few months, I’m fully convinced by what they’re building.\n\nHaving been part of several fast-growing startups and FAANG companies, I chose Artisan for a few key reasons:\n1. AI agents 🤖 are set to drive massive shifts across industries in the coming years. \n2. Jaspar and Sam have built a strong foundation, and their multi-product business model is exactly what's needed in a market saturated with SaaS point solutions.\n3. The missing piece is assembling a world-class engineering team capable of executing at the pace required to deliver multiple innovative products.\n\nI’m thrilled to bring a decade of eng leadership experience to Artisan and to help scale a high-performing engineering team that will make this vision a reality!",

  "text": "🚀 Reflecting on an Incredible Week at Artisan’s Sales Kickoff in Tulum! 🌴\n\nThis week, I had the opportunity to meet many of my Artisan colleagues in person for the first time at our 2025 #Sales Kickoff in Tulum, Mexico—and what an experience it was!\n\nFrom high-impact training sessions with Peter Ahn to deep-dive strategy discussions, one thing is clear: #Agentic AI is about to transform the entire #GTM suite.\n\nAt Artisan, we’re building an AI-powered #outbound engine that automates prospecting, outreach, and booking meetings—helping teams scale faster than ever before. The roadmap ahead is ambitious and game-changing, and I couldn’t be more excited to be part of a team that’s redefining how sales teams operate.\n\n🔥 Key Takeaways from the #SKO:\n\n✅ The future of outbound is AI-driven, multi-channel, and hyper-personalised.\n✅ AI SDRs aren’t just a replacement for traditional outbound—they’re an upgrade.\n✅ Companies that embrace AI-powered GTM strategies will outpace their competition.\n\nA huge shoutout to Tina Sang and Klara Martinkova for organizing such a seamless and unforgettable offsite. The energy, collaboration, and vision shared this week were truly inspiring.\n\nOn a personal note, this SKO coincided with a huge milestone for me:\n\n💯 100 new clients in just 194 days (Haaland-esque numbers)\n💰 Nearly $2M in ARR generated\n\nIt’s proof that AI-powered outbound is no longer a concept—it’s the future, and it’s working today.\n\nIf you're still building your sales motion around traditional SDR teams, now is the time to rethink your strategy. The companies winning in 2025 will be the ones that embrace AI for scalable, efficient, and highly effective pipeline generation.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you want a quick run-through of the platform!\n\nJaspar Carmichael-Jack Sam Stallings",

They're one of the most critical functions in a company, but our sales team spend 6+ hours per day on calls\n\nIt makes no sense for them to come into an office and sit in a tiny call booth all day\n\nThe same goes for a bunch of other roles which can thrive in a remote environment\n\nIt goes without saying that some roles work best in an in-person setting. If it's job function that requires a lot of brainstorming work, constant alignment or fast iteration, being in the office makes sense\n\nRemote and in-person both have their place in 2025. Just look at our AI BDR, Ava - she works fully remote, and it hasn't slowed her down at all 😉 \n\n———\nWe're building the future of work, and we're hiring (both in-person in SF and remote).

  "text": "A year ago, I moved to San Francisco on an O-1 Visa to build Artisan—here's the good, the bad and the ugly\n\nAt the time, we had just gotten into Y Combinator's W24 batch. On my first day in SF, my suitcase with all of my belongings was stolen from a car (the true SF welcome...) and I was living in SOMA\n\nI learned 2 important rules after that:\n1) Don't leave things in cars\n2) Don't live in SOMA\n\nEveryone talks about SF as the place to build a startup, but when I first arrived, it felt too quiet & slow - like not enough was happening\n\nAt the end of YC, despite the YC Partners' advice against moving to New York, I had told the team that we were moving the Artisan HQ there\n\nBut then, I got it. That quiet is the best thing about SF. It gives you the space to build, undisturbed, surrounded by people obsessively doing the same. No distractions, no noise—just execution\n\nSF has a uniquely tech-forward mindset—it's the only place we could have pulled off our \"Stop Hiring Humans\" billboard campaign. It's the only place where everybody understands the startup ecosystem and AI\n\nSF is a pretty monotonous and boring city, and that's why it's amazing. If you're building a B2B startup, there's no excuse to not be here\n\n----------\n\nReady to automate your BDR team's workload? Hire Ava, our AI BDR: https://lnkd.in/eHudjMTA",

If you're planning on raising, be prepared to face 100s of no's before you get a yes. Just treat each meeting and rejection as a learning experience and keep on shipping product/growing MRR - you've got this 🫡 \n\nFull deck: https://lnkd.in/dtruwWeU",

  "text": "We're expanding our Strategy & Ops function at Artisan! If I had to choose any IC role, this would be the one I'd want to do. Here’s why:\n\nWhat you’ll do:\n1. Tackle broad, high-impact challenges across the organization—e.g., “Why isn’t X growing fast enough?”\n2. Identify the key data that represents the problem, dive into it, and create actionable reports and dashboards using SQL and Tableau/Looker.\n3. Hypothesize root causes for the issues and design a clear, data-backed plan to address them.\n4. Collaborate with stakeholders to execute the plan.\n5. Monitor key metrics to ensure progress trends in the right direction.\n6. Once resolved, maintain oversight to ensure the issue stays fixed and performance remains strong.\n\nThis role is in-office in SF - consulting/IB backgrounds will likely perform well",

  "text": "I spent the weekend at the Y Combinator AI retreat where predictions were made among hundreds of founders leading the next wave of AI - here’s what I learned:\n\n1. There is a consensus that AGI is around the corner and everyone building startups is f%^*ed\n\nIn the next decade the only thing of value that companies will be able to build is status goods. Think art, fashion, etc. Anything where the value is intangible and not based on the resources that went into making it\n\n\n2. A lot of jobs are going to either disappear or change dramatically\n\nCompanies are desperate to fill roles with software, and the technology is getting to a point of convergence where we will suddenly be able to do that with a LOT of roles. Our focus this year at Artisan is prioritizing the roles we want to focus on automating\n\n3. Work 100 years ago vs now looks like playing games - it will likely be the same now vs in 100 years\n\nIf you took someone from 1925 and showed them what we do for “work” today, they’d say we have too much time and aren’t actually working. Some think the same situation will exist in 100 years - the work people will be doing will look like play to us now \n\n4. A lot of companies are building cool s*%t \n\nBeing around 100s of founders building insanely cool products with AI was inspiring- there’s an avalanche of sci fi-esque technology coming our way in the next few years",

  "text": "I did cold outbound to 100s of unicorn founders asking for advice before I started Artisan and got A LOT of responses. One was from Zeb Evans (CEO of ClickUp) who hopped on a call with me a couple of weeks later\n\nThe advice I got from them shaped the inception story of Artisan and saved me from making a lot of mistakes \n\nI went in with no understanding of the startup ecosystem and how to build a SF venture-backed startup\n\nOriginally I’d planned on raising a $500k pre-seed and had mapped out the fundraising roadmap with round sizes in the deck. I was told by many of the people I reached out to that was was stupid, I needed to raise more and shouldn’t include future rounds in the deck (in much nicer words, of course) - we then went on to raise a $12M seed\n\nThere’s 2 stories in this:\n\n1. Ask people for advice. They’re going to be willing to help more often than you think\n\n2. Outbound email works and you should hire our AI BDR, Ava ;) https://lnkd.in/egydpQPd\n\nComment below if you want me to share the advice I compiled from every unicorn founder I spoke to with you",

  "text": "Here’s what getting 1000s of death threats taught me about B2B SaaS\n\nWhen we launched our \"Stop Hiring Humans\" campaign for our AI BDR Ava, along with getting 1000s of inbound leads, we also received flood of hate messages – from (pretty funny) insults to death threats across Reddit, X, TikTok, Instagram, Threads and even through the inquiries form on our website\n\nHere are a few takeaways the experience taught me:\n\n1. Rage bait works in a B2B context\nWhile the general public outside of the tech sphere hated our messaging, they amplified it to reach more sales leaders and founders who loved it\n\n2. People who don't take risks don't win\nThe hardest thing about B2B marketing is cutting through the noise and creating a brand that people *actually* notice. Running a controversial ad campaign was a risk, but it paid off in $millions of pipeline\n\n3. Listen to your team\nWhile we were workshopping campaign messaging, we had a lot of ideas that never made it to the drawing board because they were vetoed by the team for being too boring or (believe it or not) even more controversial\n\n4. Don't worry about people's opinions unless they're in your ICP\nWhen building a product, as in life, not all criticism is constructive. Learn to filter the noise and focus on feedback that helps you grow as a company\n\n5. Security is important\nBe it cybersecurity, SOC2 Compliance or an actual bodyguard (you probably need all 3 if you're using controversial messaging)\n\nWhat doesn't kill you makes your SaaS stronger",

  "text": "We kicked off 2025 at Artisan by celebrating our wins with a team offsite in Bali 🏝️ \n\nAs much as our CEO Jaspar Carmichael-Jack likes to talk about our 70+ hour work weeks, we still know when to take breaks and appreciate everything we’ve achieved so far 😉 \n\nIt was the perfect way to kick off the new year - our team mapped out all of the ambitious goals that we want to achieve, including:\n\n- Growing the team from 30 to 100+ people\n- Scaling to $xxM ARR\n- Streamlining our internal processes to become one of the most efficient teams in Silicon Valley\n- Many more outrageous marketing campaigns like our Stop Hiring Humans one (but hopefully fewer death threats 😂)\n- Moving into new verticals that will soon be announced 👀\n\nWe’re not just building a product, we’re shaping the future of work. And to achieve these goals, we’re going to need the best team possible. If that's you, apply at artisan.co/careers\n\nIt’s one of the most exciting times to join Artisan – if you thought our growth last year was incredible, this year we’re planning to 10x it.

  "text": "As CEO at Artisan, I’m the only person who doesn’t have a college degree. Even though I didn’t go to college, you probably should\n\nWhen I was 18, I moved to London and started my first company instead of going to university\n\nWhy?\n\nOriginally, I had my sights set on studying PPE at Oxford and then founding a company\n\nBut when I was 16, I realized that going to college was going to suck 4 years of my life from me - time that I could spend ACTUALLY building a company instead of preparing to build one\n\nI dropped out of my maths class required to get into the Oxford PPE course and fully committed to spending the rest of my life building companies\n\nI spent my last 2 years of high school doing the bare minimum in class. I was focused on building, including my first “real” company, Assist, an app for people to book home services services\n\nI got special permission to use my laptop in class due to my “slow handwriting” 😉 and would sit in the back of class working on my startup\n\nI even tried to drop out of high school but my parents were not on board\n\nSo what ended up happening to my first company?\n\nIt was a total flop. In hindsight, my idea had zero potential and was set up for failure. But it taught me a lot that has helped me build Artisan today – way more than a university degree could’ve. I learned:\n\n- How to fail fast, iterate, and learn\n- What ideas are good and bad\n- How to hire and fire people\n- How to manage a team\n- How running a company works\n\n-----------\n\nBut ironically, I still think most people should go to university\n\nThe job market is tough and it’s nearly impossible to stand out\n\nI’ve never had a real job before, and realistically I probably couldn’t have gotten one\n\nAt Artisan, we get 1000s of job applications every day and one of the first things we do is filter by university/past company. It’s not ideal, but it’s the easiest way to filter through masses of candidates\n\nGetting into any sought-after career path - apart from becoming a founder - is going to require a top college degree or a lot of grinding and luck\n\nGoing to a good university definitely isn’t the hallmark of an intelligent, capable person, but it’s a surefire way to identify people that are smart and hard-working\n\nIf you’re 100% sure you want to be a founder, don’t go to university. If you want to go down a traditional career path, then do\n\nFor founders, the 4 years could be better spent learning how to build companies\n\nFor traditional careers, the 4 years dedicated to getting a top degree will catalyze the rest of your working life\n\nAnd if you have an idea that you’re sitting on, there is no better time than NOW to start your company\n\nP.S. If you did CS at Stanford, MIT or Carnegie Mellon please DM me, we’re looking for talent 😉",

It barely worked and looked like a children's game, but it was the beginning of something great\n- We started the Y Combinator W24 batch\n- I got my O-1 Visa, moved to SF and got all of my belongings stolen on day 1 (which I later recovered)!\n- We moved into our first office\n\nFebruary\n- We were featured by the BBC as leading the shift towards \"digital colleagues\"\n-Our waitlist grew to 1000s of people through rage baiting on Reddit\n\nMarch\n- We had 2nd highest monthly web traffic in our YC batch\n- Tina Sang joined the team!\n\nApril\n- We raised the biggest Seed round in our YC batch on an uncapped 20% discount SAFE\n- We launched V2 of our platform,\nmaturing us to a “real” company \n- YC ended and we co-hosted the end of batch event \n\nMay\n- I spoke at the GenAI Summit about the future of AI\n- We launched a new version of our website \n\nJune\n- We introduced dozens of new data sources for our AI BDR Ava\n- We launched publicly with a new sales-led model, revenue started growing\n- HubSpot invested in Artisan\nOur first sales hire started \n\nJuly\n- We introduced a new execution system, centered around quarterly strategies across all functions\n- 2 people joined our AI team\n- We went through a rebrand\n- We got our first billboard \n\nAugust\n- We launched a major update to email quality, making Ava’s AI-generated emails the best on market by a strong margin\n\nSeptember\n- Revenue started growing FAST\n- We shipped local business data and e-commerce data to supplement our standard B2B data offering\n\nOctober\n- We sponsored TechCrunch Disrupt\n- We shipped our “Magic Campaigns” feature, which allows Ava to thoroughly research your company and come up with your outbound messaging\n- We closed $1M of ARR in 1 month\n\nNovember\n- We launched our Stop Hiring Humans campaign\n- Our brand awareness started to take off\n- Our team grew to over 30 people\n- Our customer success team grew to 5 people\n\nDecember\n- We went viral and were features in dozens of news outlets like CBS and Fox\n- We saw an insane amount of inbound lead flow\n- I got 1000s of death threats\n- We kicked off engineering for Ava V4\n- Some other currently confidential things happened. More info coming soon 👀\n\n\n2024 was huge, but 2025 is going to be insane. We're taking Ava, our AI BDR to the next level over the next 4 months. We’re maturing to become a scale-ready company. We’re launching new products in sales. We’re launching new verticals. We’re launching new Artisans. We’re expanding internationally. We’re pushing the boundaries of what agents can do. We’re pushing the boundaries of what AI employees can do. We’re becoming a unicorn. \n\n2025 is going to be the defining year for AI Employees and we need extraordinarily talented people to help bring our vision to life. We need you.

  "text": "We got to ~$3M ARR in 5 months with our AI BDR. Here’s how. \n\nI’ve said before that winning as a startup comes down to 2 things:\n\n1. Product\n2. Distribution\n\nWe started with a pretty terrible strategy for both…\n\nOur first product sucked - we followed the YC methodology of launching early and iterating. Our MVP didn’t work, the UI was terrible and features were lacking heavily\n\nThough this was a painful process, it enabled us to iterate and build faster than we would have otherwise\n\nWe also had no brand awareness, no SEO and no GTM strategy (as you’d expect for a pre-seed startup)\n\nWe started with product-led growth, which was a terrible model for us – users never finished onboarding, our ACV was too low, the time-to-value was too long, etc\n\nThink hard about whether product-led is right for you or if you should be doing sales-led\n\n———\n\nWe rebuilt our entire strategy to hit $3m ARR in a few months\n\nProduct:\n\nWe rebuilt everything and launched V2 of our AI BDR, Ava, in May. The relaunch had a completely new UI and features our users had been asking for. We did 100s of user interviews to understand what our users wanted, and built:\n\n- Live lead research across LinkedIn, X, news and the web to create hyper-personalized emails and LI messages\n\n- New data sources to complement our B2B data including E-Commerce and Local Business Data\n\n- Magic Campaigns, so Ava can create your campaign messaging for you \n+ much more\n\nWe’re working on a huge release for V4 of Artisan in Q1, so stay tuned 🦄\n\nDistribution:\n\nWe built an extremely robust GTM strategy, spanning:\n\n- A comprehensive outbound strategy using Ava, our AI BDR\n- Our SF “Stop Hiring Humans” billboard campaign\n- Our TechCrunch Disrupt sponsorship\n- Ramped up SEO efforts\n- Funding announcements combined with big brand pushes \n\n———\n\nWe’re now consistently closing ~$1M of ARR every month and will continue to double down our efforts on building the best product on the market & maintaining our position as a market leader in AI Sales & AI Employees\n\nWe have some VERY exciting new products beyond just outbound coming early next year 🤓\n\nIf you want to learn more about Ava: https://lnkd.in/erKwdu4i",

  "text": "2 months ago, I moved into the Artisan House with Jaspar Carmichael-Jack and Sam Stallings. Here’s what it’s been like living with my startup founders: \n\n1. We've built a deeper connection than we ever could in an office \n\nFor most teams, being in-person is enough to create the bond that a startup thrives on. Living together takes that bond to another level\n\nI had visited SF before, back when we worked out of an office in downtown. It was productive & I got to know the team better—but it wasn’t until we started living together that we actually became friends \n\n2. We collaborate on everything \n\nNot just on GTM strategies or product roadmaps, but also on coordinating chores & keeping everything running smoothly. Our ability to work together to solve problems & resolve conflict is tested daily, like when our ceiling started leaking in the middle of the night...\n\n3. Constant alignment/brainstorming\n\nIdeas don’t wait for office hours. Some of our most productive discussions happen over dinner or right before bed - living together creates a continuous flow of creativity and problem-solving that traditional work environments can’t match\n\nThere have been so many significant events & last-minute decisions and having immediate access to each other has been crucial for executing effectively (like helping Sam choose an outfit the night before F1 😂)\n\n4. We trust each other a lot more\n\nLiving together removes any room for pretense. You share wins, losses, and vulnerabilities, which strengthens both personal bonds and the company culture\n\nThis allows for an openness in communication that would take much longer to develop otherwise\n\n---\n\nLiving with your team is definitely not for everyone — and I wouldn't recommend it unless you think it can work well. But for us at least, it’s convinced us that with the right people, it can really amplify your output\n\nThe past few months have been a rollercoaster, and it's been a privilege to ride out both the highs and the lows together \n\nWe've also flown out many of our employees (already 5 this month) for mini on-sites to experience the environment of living and working together\n\nIt's definitely expedited my own growth - by living in the same space as my team, I've learned a lot in a remarkably short period of time. There have been so many more opportunities to ask, learn, listen & ensure that what I'm doing is on the right track\n\n(We're looking for more in-person employees to join our team in SF, so get in touch if you're interested: artisan.co/careers)",

  "text": "🎉 50 Deals – Not Out! 🏏\n\nThree months and two days ago, I joined Artisan. Today, I’m proud to share that I’ve just closed my 50th deal! 🙌\n\nReflecting on this milestone, I wanted to share some of the strategies that have helped me achieve this:\n\n1️⃣ Ava, our AI BDR, is a game-changer – She books in all of my meetings, saving me countless hours on outbounding, to focus on actually speaking with clients.\n\n2️⃣ Qualification matters – I ensure every call is tailored to our clients, focusing on businesses that are serious about scaling their B2B outreach.\n\n3️⃣ Practice makes perfect – Taking ~16 calls daily means the pitch is sharp, and the demo flows naturally.\n\n4️⃣ Dig deep into the pain points – Understanding current processes helps me highlight how Artisan can solve their challenges and add value.\n\n5️⃣ Follow through – Saying you’ll do something and actually doing it builds trust and credibility.\n\n6️⃣ Relentless follow-ups – Keeping every lead informed so they can make confident decisions.\n\n7️⃣ Smile and connect – People buy from people, and building rapport goes a long way.\n\n8️⃣ ☕ Coffee. Lots of coffee.\n\nThis journey has been an amazing ride, and I’m excited about what’s ahead. Next stop, bringing in $1M ARR...\n\nHats off to the developers for building an incredible product that sells itself and to my clients for trusting me with their outreach!\n\nIf you're curious about how Artisan AI can transform your sales process, let’s chat! 🚀\n\nJaspar Carmichael-Jack Sam Stallings\n#Sales #ArtisanAI #Milestones #50Deals #AI #B2BSales",

There’s a LOT to come for our AI BDR Ava over the next few months\n\nSam, Tina and I have been doing as many 1-on-1 customer check-ins as possible to ensure we’re getting direct user feedback and have a tight feedback loop\n\n------\n\nWe’ve built the strongest brand awareness of any AI SDR company and it drives us 100s of inbound leads weekly\n\nSponsoring TechCrunch Disrupt & putting up billboards of Ava all over SF was a huge investment, but our brand awareness has skyrocketed – the market is so competitive that it’s more important than ever to position ourselves as the market leader\n\n------\n\nOctober has been our most successful month ever, which is exciting, but this is just the beginning.

  "text": "A lot can change in a year. Last year at TechCrunch Disrupt, I was struggling to raise pre-seed funding for Artisan. This year we sponsored it 🤠\n\nI went to TechCrunch in 2023 on a mission to raise a $2M pre-seed. Safe to say it did not work out... We were (fairly) rejected 100s of times for being too early\n\nWith all of my life savings in the company and 2 months of runway left, I was stressed to say the least\n\nBut, one call can change everything. My first call with Oliver Jung a few weeks after the conference did exactly that. He took a chance on us and wrote the first check into Artisan\n\nA couple of weeks later we got into Y Combinator's W24 batch, and our pace has been insane ever since \n\nThis time last year we had no product, no revenue, no team and 2 months of runway left. \n\nIn 2024, we:\n- Raised a $12M seed\n- Launched 3 iterations of our AI BDR product \n- Became a market leader in AI Sales\n- Closed over $1M of ARR in 30 days\n\nWe would not be where we are today without the 100s of people who have supported us on this journey - it really does take a village\n\nNever give up – keep building and you’ll get there sooner than you think",

  "text": "Being Chief of Staff means doing whatever the company needs - and often, doing the things that no one else wants to do.\n\nI’ve just spent the past few days learning how to set up domains and configure mailboxes for 100s of our customers because our technical support person is on emergency leave.\n\nIt's been late nights of fielding dozens of support tickets and auditing every customer's account to make sure we're still providing the best support we can for every user. I’ve had a crash course in MX, SPF, DKIM, etc records and while it's definitely not my strong suit, it's what's most important to jump on right now\n\nThis kind of mentality is important no matter what role you are in a startup - there will always be changing priorities and fires to put out. You want to build a team of people who can take on anything that the situation requires\n\nYou’ll never build a successful early-stage team if everyone is only willing to do what’s in their job description and that’s it. \n\nThat’s the great thing about the team at Artisan. No matter what role people are, they're always willing to lend a hand - our AEs help QA new platform features, our engineers give feedback on our graphic designs & everyone pitches in where they can\n\nBut we also celebrate hard work & recognize when people are going the extra mile - like Jaspar Carmichael-Jack & Sam Stallings surprising me with a cake yesterday 😂 \n\nThis is what will set us apart from all the other players in the space - a team that is willing to put in 110% where it’s needed & champion this spirit\n\nEverything we’ve achieved so far couldn’t have been done by one person. But together, we’ve gotten to where we are today - $12m in funding, $1.8m in ARR & 90% MoM growth 🚀",

When our Google API use wasn’t approved the night before a webinar, I messaged the Google Cloud CEO on LinkedIn and the issue was solved within an hour \n\nHuge shoutout to Thomas Kurian and the whole Google Cloud team for this - having that level of customer centricity as a multi-trillion dollar company is wild :)\n\nHere are a few other times this has worked for me:\n\n\n1. We raised a pre-seed by sending cold LinkedIn messages when all we had was a deck and a dream\n\nI truly never though this was going to work, but within a few weeks of starting raising, we had over $2M\n\n2. I saw a billboard outside our office window - we had Ava's face on it within a week, and we were able to negotiate the price down by 80%\n\n3. A couple of years ago I set up a cold email campaign to every unicorn founder asking for advice and got a 5% response rate \n\nThe advice they gave me played into the decisions I made in the early days at Artisan \n\nRemember:\n\n- The worst case scenario is somebody saying \"no\"\n- Not asking guarantees you won't get it\n\nDon't fear rejection - embrace it. Treat every \"no\" you get as being one step closer to a \"yes\".",

  "text": "We just crossed the official 1 year anniversary of Artisan! It's been an incredible journey full of ups and downs. We're now at a crazy inflection point - we just raised a (now $12.1M) Seed, we're days away from crossing $1.5M ARR and are preparing to raise our Series A very soon - here's what I've learned:\n\n1. SF is boring, and that's why not being here is startup su*cide\n\nA friend once told me that SF's boringness is \"a feature not a bug\" and that stuck with me. Earlier this year I almost moved our team to New York - and while that would have been significantly more fun, it would in no way propel us towards our goal of building a generational company \n\nIf you really care about your startup, you should be building in SF \n\n2. You need to make a LOT of noise\n\nWe're the newest player in the AI SDR space and probably the best known. If you want to me a market leader, you should be shouting from the rooftops and doing what you need to do to get eyeballs... some might have noticed our multiple Seed announcements ;)\n\n3. Competition is fun\n\nWe have some very close competitors, and while a lot of people would find that intimidating, our entire team love it. There's nothing like competition to light a fire under your team to build better products, grow faster, and execute better\n\n4. There's nothing I'd rather do\n\nBuilding a company is a rollercoaster, but I genuinely believe it is one of the most rewarding and exciting things you can do. I want to be building Artisan for the next 20 years. We've got our eyes on IPO 👀 \n\nIf you're interested in joining our team and helping us build the next paradigm of software as we go through this hypergrowth phase, apply at https://lnkd.in/ePZACACq :)",

Post on ALL channels\nWe get strong traction for our fundraising news on LinkedIn, X, Reddit (by doing AMAs) and Instagram. If you don't post it everywhere, you're missing our on eyes\n\n2. Have a hook\nNobody cares about your fundraising news unless you can relate it to them and make it emotive. We focused on the AI Employees angle and how they inevitably will take jobs - something everybody have a visceral reaction to\n\n3. Ask investors and employees to repost the news\nTag all of your investors, and contact every employee and stakeholder asking them to repost your news (specifically the post from the CEO's profile)\n\n4. Getting coverage from the right outlets and have an embargo\nGetting coverage in Forbes and VentureBeat made people care about what we were saying. We couldn't have done that without Day One Ventures and Tara Harandi-Zadeh who handled the entire PR process for us. They set an embargo to make sure all press coverage went out at the same time, going for the \"surround sound effect\n\n5. Post before your competitors\nFind out if/when your closest competitors are announcing news and beat them to it\n\nOur 5 awesome sales reps are all fully booked for the next 2 weeks, but if you want to find out why so many people are desperate to hire our AI BDR Ava, you can find time to chat with them at https://lnkd.in/d3zaVPVB (there might be a cancellation you can snag 👀 )",

  "text": "Excited to announce our $11.5M Seed at Artisan! \n\nAt Artisan, we're solving 2 major problems:\n- There are too many (bad) SaaS products. There's a sea of clunky feature-products that don't talk to each other, cost too much and lead to endless context switching and data entry\n- Humans do too much work. Every day, millions of people open their computer and spend 8 hours doing manual, highly automatable work\n\nWe're creating consolidated, easy-to-use software and AI Employees called Artisans to address these issues.\n\nOur first Artisan is Ava, the AI BDR. She finds and researches leads using dozens of data sources, send them hyper-personalized messages on LinkedIn and email, manages deliverability and so much more. \n\nI spoke to Forbes about the round & what’s in store for Artisan looking forward. Read about it here: https://lnkd.in/eie6Yg5N.\n\nSince launching Ava, we've crossed $1 million ARR and onboarded 100s of customers. If you want to learn more about Ava, let's chat: https://lnkd.in/erKwdu4i\n\nThe round was led by Oliver Jung, with participation from HubSpot Ventures, Masha Bucher from Day One Ventures, Y Combinator, Fellows Fund, BOND, Sequoia Capital Scout, 10x Founders, Aneel Ranadive from Soma Capital, Gopher Asset Management, CoreNest, Mento vc, Anu Hariharan, Paul Daversa, David J. Phillips, Teddy Nwachuku, Lawrence Lin Murata, Nick E., Alexander Galicki, Eugenio Carnemolla, Stevan Nenadov, David Job de Picciotto, Kenny Denton, AIP Seed, and Daniel Paley.\n\nThis is just the beginning - we have tons of exciting features in our roadmap for outbound sales and some awesome new Artisans in the pipeline\n\nWe’re looking for talented people to help us build the next paradigm of software 🚀 Get in touch if you’re interested: https://lnkd.in/ePZACACq",

  "text": "In 3 years there will be no human BDRs.\n\nOk maybe that's slightly dramatic but there will be significantly less. The role of a BDR has become increasingly automated, but until now, no technology could fully replicate what a human can do. That’s about to change\n\nI've chatted with 100s of BDRs who are excited about Artisan. No BDRs actually want to be BDRs - they want to build human relationships in an AE role\n\nAnd companies are ready to spend less on their BDR org. For reference, Ava (our AI BDR) costs 90%+ less than the equivalent human output\n\nTraditionally, the BDR role consists of a series of extremely manual tasks:\n\nBuild a list of contacts from a B2B data provider\nVerify their contact info\nLook for personalizations across their LinkedIn, X, news, etc\nProspect through channels like email, phone, or social media\nFollow up\nRespond to objections\nBook in meetings\nUpdate CRM\n\nAutomation has been slowly eating away at the BDR’s role for a long time and we're approaching a fully autonomous AI BDR. By 2025, AI BDRs will be list building, prospecting, qualifying over the phone, objection handling, booking meetings, taking notes, and updating CRMs autonomously\n\nAva already automates 80% of a BDRs role, finding leads, collecting data on from dozens of sources to effectively personalize emails and LinkedIn messages at scale, and managing deliverability\n\nNone of our prospects that receive Ava’s emails even realize she’s AI. Ava ghostwrites on behalf of humans\n\nAva is changing the way sales orgs function. You can learn more at https://lnkd.in/dX2Jscxj",

  "text": "Your first 5 hires at a startup determine whether it lives or dies. Here are the first hires we made at Artisan that put us on the path to $1M ARR:\n\n1. Engineer\n2. Engineer\n3. Product Manager\n4. Product Designer\n5. Chief of Staff\n\nHere’s how each hire played a fundamental role in getting us from 0 to 1:\n\n1 & 2.  Engineer:\n\nOur first product is all-in-one outbound sales platform that consolidates 10s of tools and contains an AI BDR. We couldn’t build that with just one person – we needed more manpower\n\nThe first hires we made were engineers (one FE, one BE) and they were instrumental in building our MVP\n\n3. Product Manager:\n\nWe’ve always been product obsessed, and every feature we create needs to be 10x better than existing solutions\n\nTo help us ensure this, we hired a PM who eventually became my co-founder, Sam!\n\n4. Product Designer:\n\nMost B2B software looks tired We want to create B2B SaaS that feels like using a consumer app\n\nThe UI of our MVP was terrible when we first launched it, and we realized how important it was to have a great interface so customers would actually enjoy using the product\n\nWe hired a Product Designer so we could create the best UI of any AI SDR tool on the market – and it has made a fundamental difference to our users’ experience\n\n5. Chief of Staff:\n\nMost startups don’t hire a CoS until post Series A. But the value you get from hiring a talented generalist that can do everything is extremely underrated\n\nMy CoS Tina was able to take full days of sales calls, create really strong content for our marketing channels & help with hiring demands and expanding our existing team\n\nNow that we’ve hit $1M and are shifting focus to scaling existing processes, we’re looking to hire more drivers (especially engineers) to help us scale to $10M and beyond\n\nBuilding the right team has enabled us to build the best AI SDR. We have the most comprehensive data, wide-reaching set of features, best personalizations, and an unparalleled user experience\n\nIf you want to see Ava & Artisan for yourself, you can book a demo here: https://lnkd.in/erKwdu4i",

  "text": "4% of startups close $1M ARR – We did it in 3 months, and have closed $400k in the past month alone. Here’s how:\n\n1. We found the most successful B2B growth channels, and we’re giving them to you\n\nWe’ve built an inbound machine that delivers 50+ leads per day and we’ve put together a full breakdown of our best growth channels for you: https://lnkd.in/ek4xY7aZ\n\n\n2. We switched from product-led to sales-led, and maybe you should too\n\nWe tried PLG and it didn’t work for us. Our product requires setup and hands-on support, which wasn’t viable with a product led motion. (You can read more about it in my post here: https://lnkd.in/eGjdmJnq) \n\nOnce we ​​switched to a sales-led motion, our growth instantly took off \n\n\n3. We hired superstar AEs and built strong sales processes\n\nOur AEs are closing machines – one of our newest AEs has closed $300k of ARR in his first month \n\nTo support them, we’ve built out robust and automated sales processes. We have everything clearly documented in SOPs and automate anything we can\n\n\n4. We’re working hard to maximize our users’ value\n\nOur users being successful is extremely important to us and with an AI BDR, that means them getting leads. \n\nTo improve our users’ results, we are:\n\nLooking at user performance to see which kinds of businesses are performing the best with our AI BDR, Ava and targeting similar companies in our marketing\n\nLaunching a bunch of new features to improve Ava’s response rate (we just launched V3 and are doing another huge release next month - more info to come in the next few weeks!)\n\nMaking sure our users’ have amazing messaging on their accounts by manually auditing them - doing things that don’t scale\n\nIf you want to automate your outbound motion, let Ava get you leads on autopilot, and make this chart even prettier, have a chat with our sales team ;) https://lnkd.in/erKwdu4i",

  "text": "Product-led growth almost killed our startup - don't let it kill yours.\n\nWe’re closing $100,000s of ARR for our AI SDR product every month since switching to a sales-led approach\n\nWhen we launched our beta product in February of this year, we started with a self-serve model\n\nThe \"product-led is best\" narrative that exists in the startup world is frankly not right for most companies\n\nTo be successful with a product-led approach, you need:\n- An easy-to-onboard product\n- A service that is viable at a low cost\n- A fast time-to-value\n\nWe don't have all of those things (and nor do most startups):\n\n1. Our users need to deep dive their ICP and messaging to set up Ava, our AI SDR. It's much easier when they do this with a customer success manager (most people won't spend an hour doing something without somebody else keeping them accountable) \n\n2. To do outbound effectively, you need to do high volume and you need hands-on support - that isn't cheap. To see strong results, our users need to spend at least $1-2k/mo\n\n3. With Artisan, you have to wait for your mailboxes to warm up and for Ava to find the right messaging to start seeing value, which can take a few weeks. That is way too long for a product-led motion\n\nIf you're running a startup, ask yourself if your product meets those 3 criteria. If it doesn't, you should probably be sales-led\n\nAfter we switched to sales-led a few months ago, our growth exploded\n\nI talked about this last week at Product Hunt x Hexus’ panel on GTM for PLG vs SLG companies\n\nIf you're interesting in hiring Ava and seeing what she can do as your AI SDR, you can chat with our amazing new sales team at https://lnkd.in/d3zaVPVB",

  "text": "I'm turning 23 today, which makes me the youngest employee at Artisan as CEO 🤠\n\nI’ve always been obsessed with companies. I started my first “business” when I was 7 (a candy store in my bedroom, as seen in the below pic…)\n\nFast forward to a decade later, and I made the decision not to go to university and instead to start an app for booking cleaners & errand runners called Assist. \n\nThe app failed for many reasons (classic tar pit idea with horrible unit economics, operational overhead and my lack of experience), but I learned an insane amount about how not to start/run a company\n\nThrough that failed startup and the relatively successful GTM agency I started after (both of which were during the years I would have otherwise been at college), I learned more than I ever could have in a degree\n\nI started Artisan using all of those learnings last year when I was 21, and since then, we’ve:\n- Done Y Combinator\n- Raised the biggest seed round of any YC company in our batch\n- Closed over $1M in ARR\n- Built an amazing, mission-driven team\n- Continuously executed on our mission of building a trillion-dollar company\n\nA few key learnings I would share with anyone, but especially young people are:\n- Be confident. Confidence when starting and leading a company will help you get the best talent, investors, etc\n- Don’t be afraid to create your own path. If school isn’t right for you, don’t go\n- Just start. If you want to build a company, do it. The longer you wait, the less you learn. Stop procrastinating\n- Educate yourself. There’s an insane amount of resources available (YC’s YouTube channel, startup books, etc) \n- Don’t give up, but be adaptive. Don’t continue to do something that clearly isn’t going to work, but give it your absolute best shot. If it’s clear it won’t work, pivot your strategy\n\n\nIf you want something, go get it",

  "text": "I’m happy to share that I’m starting a new position as Account Executive at Artisan!\n\n\nIncredibly excited to be joining the amazing team at Artisan. They’ve achieved so much in such a short amount of time - a $7.3M seed round & $700K ARR closed in just the last two months. Excited to be supporting them in their fast-paced growth, to help bring ARR into the millions! \n\nWhen I first did my initial research on the company & saw what they were doing, I knew they had something special - they're building AI employees to automate the work that people hate, so people can focus on the work they love. Artisan is starting with outbound sales, building an AI BDR that automatically finds leads, researches them, and writes personalized emails.\n\nWhat really put me over the edge though, was catching a glimpse of the roadmap - so many insane and exciting things planned. \n\nHuge shoutout to Tina Sang & Jaspar Carmichael-Jack for a great interview process - their drive & passion for Artisan was incredibly obvious from the start  🤝",

  "text": "Since I founded Artisan less than a year ago, we have shipped product, grown revenue, and built a functioning company faster than nearly any other startup founded at the same time. The only reason we’re able to move so fast is because of our relentless focus on execution. \n\nExecution is more important than anything else - a great strategy is nothing if isn’t actioned. We have strong processes in place to maintain our execution flow:\n\n1. We create a quarterly strategy which is the cornerstone of everything we do - it covers every function within the company and lays out KPIs, goals and deliverables\n\n2. We then break our strategy down into clear, categorized line item tasks of every required input to achieve the outlined goals and deliverables \n\n3. Each task and business function has a point person assigned. Strategies and tasks are nothing without accountability \n\n4. Tasks are prioritized based on size, impact and priority and then put into sprints in our project management software\n\n5. We have a weekly accountability sync to make sure everyone has the required resources to execute\n\nIf your startup doesn’t have exceptional processes around execution, you’re never going to succeed. I’ve put together an execution processes document the details how to get your execution machine humming - comment below if you’d like me to send it across to you\n\n(We will be sending our GTM channel breakdown to those who requested it next Tuesday. The team are making some edits to perfect it after receiving 100s of requests!)\n\nArtisan Sales and Ava, our AI BDR already replace and automate the entire outbound sales stack, and we have some insane product releases coming over the next few months.

  "text": "Trying to build a unicorn without a mission-driven cuture is setting yourself up for failure. So we got a hacker house.\n\nWe've rented a house in SF and some of our team have now moved in together. We got a huge billboard of Ava (our AI BDR) outside our window, so she can work with us too! \n\nWe've been flying out our remote employees for in-person sprints. 5 of our team have already come to work with us in person, and it's led to some of the most productive weeks we've had.\n\nIn the span of a few weeks, we've:\n- Built our strategy for the remainder of 2024\n- Started laying the groundwork for our next Artisan 👀\n- Mapped out our V4 sales product roadmap\n- Done an in-person engineering sprint\n- Gotten closer as a team\n\nBuilding culture among a remote team can be difficult, and it’s something I’m learning more about and getting better at every day. \n\nA few of our early learning with remote/hybrid culture have led to us doing the following:\n\n- A weekly All Hands that reiterates our mission, aligns the team and celebrates wins \n\n- Developing 6 core company principles which we encourage everyone to live by, centered around how we interact with others, operate, and treat our customers\n\n- Clearly defining our mission. Everyone on the team knows we’re building a $100bn company and redefining the broken software landscape\n\n- Only having the best people. Our team are extraordinary talented, work hard and seek perfection. We hold that bar with new additions  \n\n- Making Slack fun! Our Slack is full of custom emojis and key stats are sent to different channels daily. We try to keep the “office door knock” vibe by heavily using huddles\n\nAnd as we rapidly grow Artisan, we're looking for insanely talented people to help us build the next paradigm of software - with consolidation and automation at the core of our mission. We're looking for passionate builders who want to pave the way for the next Industrial Revolution.\n\nIf that excites you, get in touch: http://artisan.co/careers",

    "text": "Happy to share that after a whirlwind 6 months at Artisan, I've been promoted to Chief of Staff!\n\nThe past few months have felt like years in terms of how much I've learned.\n\nWhen I first joined, I definitely wasn't qualified to be a fully fledged Chief of Staff. I had to learn almost everything from scratch, and it didn’t always go well. I was asked to lead the website redesign strategy just 1 month in, and let's just say it was a bit of a 💩show…\n\nBut fast forward to now, and I’m taking the lead on:\n* Our SEO and content strategy\n* Our social media strategy\n* Our website strategy\n\n& on top of that, I'm supporting across our hiring, GTM, sales & customer success functions.\n\nHow did I get promoted so fast?\n\nThere isn't one easy answer, but the following factors definitely helped expedite my journey:\n\n1. Flying out to work with the team in person. \n\nRemote work stunts growth. If you're early in your career, you NEED to be in person. Only then will you get the opportunity to ask questions, learn from existing behavior, and really understand the nuances of the job. If I only got brief windows of time with the team, I would've barely learned anything.\n\n2. Having a figure-it-out mindset. \n\nThere were so many things I didn't know how to do, but they were usually things no one else knew how to do either. Being at a startup is all about reinventing the playbook and finding better, faster ways of doing things.\n\n3. Being thrown into the deep end. \n\nAlthough that first website project didn't go well, it taught me what I needed to do to succeed the second time. I had to race to keep up with my existing environment, which helped me way more than any handholding would've.\n\n4. Not giving into doubt.\n\nAs cheesy as it sounds, I didn't let imposter syndrome take over. I did the best I could for everything I was tasked, and eventually, things started clicking in place.\n\n5. Capturing learning opportunities everywhere. \n\nWe've hired exceptional talent across every department at Artisan. I've scheduled weekly syncs with people who excel in areas where I'm looking to grow.\n\nIt’s been a wild ride & looking forward to what the future holds! \n\nIf reading this post has got you excited about working somewhere fast-paced, then we want to hear from you. We're hiring for virtually every role right now - get in touch by filling out the form at artisan.co/careers.",

  "text": "Artisan has just closed over $700k of ARR in 2 months. This is how I joined the founding team of a hyper-growth startup, without any relevant experience.\n\nI spent a year applying to tech startups without getting any interviews or responses. I knew AI was a field I wanted to go into, but had no idea where to start. I only had ~1 year of experience working in PR, which would hardly make me stand out in a sea of applicants.\n\nHere's what I did in that year, which finally landed me the CoS role at Artisan:\n\n1. Created a list of AI startups that were fast growth, recently raised funding. I checked their job listings religiously.\n\n2. Went to local networking events for founders and startups.\n\n3. Checked the YC job board daily.\n\n4. Used AI in every part of my life and read up on it constantly.\n\n5. Reached out to people I thought were interesting on LinkedIn for coffee chats & insights into the industry.\n\n6. Applied to every open listing that I was remotely interested in.\n\nIn December 2023, I got an interview with ElevenLabs. It was the first sign since I started my job hunt that someone was interested. The interviews went well, but as a Series A company, they were looking for someone with way more experience. I was crushed.\n\nIn January, I applied to Artisan via their careers form (artisan.co/careers), not expecting to hear back. The next day, Jaspar Carmichael-Jack messaged me to chat.\n\nHere's what I did during the interview process that landed me the job:\n\n1. Phrased my background to justify every step of my journey. I studied English at Oxford (talent for storytelling), went into PR (business operations interest), then moved from healthcare to tech (wanted to contribute to tech's global impact).\n\n2. Was extremely responsive & hard working. I left Saturday plans early for a follow-up interview, spent all of Sunday on my interview task, and worked trial evenings until 12am, after my usual 9 to 5.\n\n3. Excelled at a tough task. Because I lacked experience, I was given a mammoth task to create a website strategy for Artisan's next product launch. I had no idea where to start. GPT was my consultant through the whole process, helping me create a framework from which to work from.\n\n4. Showed confidence in the value I COULD bring, despite my non-traditional background.\n\nExperience shouldn't matter in hiring. Look for intelligence, resourcefulness, scrappiness - qualities for thriving in fast-paced environments. Artisan took a chance on me, which paid off through my rapid growth and dedication.\n\nBuild these qualities:\n- Resourcefulness\n- An insane work ethic\n- Perseverance\n- Confidence in your value\n\n and you'll catch someone's eye soon.\n\nI've created a full doc on how to land the job you want. Comment below & I'll share it with you!",

  "text": "We've closed ~$700k of ARR within 2 months as a seed stage startup.\n\nMost startups fail at our stage because they can’t build enough traction to sustain long-term growth.\n\nWhy?\n\nTraditional growth channels are dying - startups are burning cash, time, and morale by chasing ghosts.\n\nWe've cracked the code by building a lead gen machine that delivers ~50 qualified leads every day.\n\nHere's how we did it:\n\n1. Building a product that people want\n\nIt doesn't matter how great your marketing is - if no one needs/wants what you're building, you won't close any deals\n\nWe ask the right questions in user interviews & sales calls, and feed those insights directly to our roadmap. Our AI BDR Ava is 1% of what our future product is going to be\n\n2. Creating engaging content on LinkedIn\n\nFounder and thought leadership content is our secret weapon\n\nSharing our journey & wins is a huge channel for us. It's gotten us 1000s of leads and 10s of investors\n\nAwareness spreads like wildfire (and it’s completely free)\n\n3. Using Ava, our own outbound engine\n\nA strong flow of leads are generated by our AI BDR product, Ava\n\nIn-depth personalization is key for getting responses from leads, and we're launching a huge update to take this to the next level in a few weeks - learn more about Ava at https://lnkd.in/eAJ28nnS\n\n4. Tapping into the YC network\n\nWe're the leading outbound product in the YC ecosystem, and have YC companies turning to us every day to support building their outbound demand generation engine. If you're an early-stage founder with a B2B product with category-leading potential, apply to YC\n\n5. Exploring a number of GTM channels\n\nWe've tested too many GTM channels to list here (SEO, blog content, influencer,  press, events, etc) and have learned a lot about what works/doesn't work for early stage B2B SaaS companies. If you want me to send you a breakdown of our analysis of different channels, leave a comment below\n\nGreat content + diversity of GTM channels + amazing product = Startup growth on steroids.\n\nOur approach proves that with the right strategy, seed-stage startups can achieve remarkable results in a short time.",

  "text": "Are AI SDRs able to replace humans yet?\n\nAt Artisan we think it'll happen soon. But what's definitely true is that your human SDRs are burning out, missing quotas, and costing you a fortune. Meanwhile, AI SDRs are working 24/7, never complaining, and delivering hot leads directly into your inbox.\n\nFacts:\n- Only 17% of human reps hit 90%+ of quota\n- AI SDRs can automate 80% of outbound tasks\n- They're scalable, consistent, and way cheaper than a human\n\nImagine your top performers freed from grunt work, focusing solely on high-value interactions. That's not the future - it's happening now. Your competition is already using AI to flood their pipeline while you're stuck in the stone age, too scared to take a risk.\n\nIt's time to adapt. Or explain to your board why you're hemorrhaging market share to companies embracing the AI revolution. The choice is yours.\n\nIf you want to learn more about AI SDRs and which ones are ready to replace your sales team, check out our latest blog here:",
