Artisan is on a mission to consolidate and replace legacy tools with one exceptional platform and build AI Employees to manage the software for you. Starting with outbound sales, they have plans to create consolidated software and Artisans for Marketing, Customer Support, Recruitment and more.

30,"I’m excited to announce that we’ve raised a $25M Series A at Artisan to make our AI BDR Ava even more effective and build 2 more AI Employees this year

It was great to sit down with Julie Bort from TechCrunch to talk about what’s next for Artisan. It's refreshing how strong of an understanding Julie and the TC team have of the space. You can read the article here: https://lnkd.in/ei3gecF9

Two years ago, I was building a company I wasn’t passionate about. I was always looking for what would be next, and felt unfulfilled

I knew I wanted to build a truly impactful company, and when I had the idea for Artisan, I knew it could be exactly that. There is a paradigm shift taking place in software which we are betting everything on - the move from unintelligent sprawling SaaS to AI-first, consolidated products

It wasn’t smooth sailing to begin with, I was turned down by over 100 investors when I first started raising (to be fair, we didn’t have a product...)

Then Oliver Jung took a bet on us and gave us our first check for $1.75M

We got into Y Combinator shortly after that, and it’s been an insane journey since then

In the past 12 months, we’ve:
- Built Ava, the AI BDR - our flagship Artisan
- Closed hundreds of customers
- Reached $5M ARR
- Gone viral with 1B+ online impressions on our “Stop Hiring Humans” shock marketing campaign
- Hired an incredible team, including our new CTO Ming Li

And we’re just getting started

We’re extremely excited to have Paul Hudson from Glade Brook Capital Partners LLC joining our board. Oliver introduced me to Paul last August and he, along with the wider Glade Brook team (Isabel Swope, Linda Guo), has been an invaluable resource to us. There’s nobody we’d rather be partnering with at this stage of our growth

We’re also grateful to Y Combinator for their reinvestment and continued support, and especially our group partner Pete Koomen who has been there day and night to help with whatever the issue of the hour is

In our roadmap for 2025, we’re launching:
- Aaron the Inbound SDR Artisan 
- Aria the Meeting Assistant Artisan
- + more to be announced

This round brings our total funding to over $35M. Thank you to every investor who has supported us: HubSpot Ventures, Masha Bucher and Tara Harandi-Zadeh from Day One Ventures, TriplePoint Capital, Fellows Fund, BOND, Sequoia Capital Scout, 10x Founders, Aneel Ranadive from Soma Capital, Olive Technology Ventures, CoreNest Capital, Mento vc, Anu Hariharan, Paul Daversa, David J.

34,"We've closed ~$700k of ARR within 2 months as a seed stage startup.

Most startups fail at our stage because they can’t build enough traction to sustain long-term growth.

Why?

Traditional growth channels are dying - startups are burning cash, time, and morale by chasing ghosts.

We've cracked the code by building a lead gen machine that delivers ~50 qualified leads every day.

Here's how we did it:

1. Building a product that people want

It doesn't matter how great your marketing is - if no one needs/wants what you're building, you won't close any deals

We ask the right questions in user interviews & sales calls, and feed those insights directly to our roadmap. Our AI BDR Ava is 1% of what our future product is going to be

2. Creating engaging content on LinkedIn

Founder and thought leadership content is our secret weapon

Sharing our journey & wins is a huge channel for us. It's gotten us 1000s of leads and 10s of investors

Awareness spreads like wildfire (and it’s completely free)

3. Using Ava, our own outbound engine

A strong flow of leads are generated by our AI BDR product, Ava

In-depth personalization is key for getting responses from leads, and we're launching a huge update to take this to the next level in a few weeks - learn more about Ava at https://lnkd.in/eAJ28nnS

4. Tapping into the YC network

We're the leading outbound product in the YC ecosystem, and have YC companies turning to us every day to support building their outbound demand generation engine. If you're an early-stage founder with a B2B product with category-leading potential, apply to YC

5. Exploring a number of GTM channels

We've tested too many GTM channels to list here (SEO, blog content, influencer,  press, events, etc) and have learned a lot about what works/doesn't work for early stage B2B SaaS companies. If you want me to send you a breakdown of our analysis of different channels, leave a comment below

Great content + diversity of GTM channels + amazing product = Startup growth on steroids.

Our approach proves that with the right strategy, seed-stage startups can achieve remarkable results in a short time.",2024-07-30 20:39:02,8 months ago • Edited • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn,Jaspar,Carmichael-Jack,"Founder & CEO at Artisan 🦄 | Building AI Employees | Hire Ava, Our AI BDR Artisan",298,14,832,image,No,1456,No,Weve closed 700k of ARR within 2 months as a seed stage startup Most startups fail at our stage because they cant build enough traction to sustain longterm growth Why Traditional growth channels are dying startups are burning cash time and morale by chasing ghosts Weve cracked the code by building a lead gen machine that delivers 50 qualified leads every day Heres how we did it 1 Building a product that people want It doesnt matter how great your marketing is if no one needswants what youre building you wont close any deals We ask the right questions in user interviews sales calls and feed those insights directly to our roadmap Our AI BDR Ava is 1 of what our future product is going to be 2 Creating engaging content on LinkedIn Founder and thought leadership content is our secret weapon Sharing our journey wins is a huge channel for us Its gotten us 1000s of leads and 10s of investors Awareness spreads like wildfire and its completely free 3 Using Ava our own outbound engine A strong flow of leads are generated by our AI BDR product Ava Indepth personalization is key for getting responses from leads and were launching a huge update to take this to the next level in a few weeks learn more about Ava at 4 Tapping into the YC network Were the leading outbound product in the YC ecosystem and have YC companies turning to us every day to support building their outbound demand generation engine If youre an earlystage founder with a B2B product with categoryleading potential apply to YC 5 Exploring a number of GTM channels Weve tested too many GTM channels to list here SEO blog content influencer press events etc and have learned a lot about what worksdoesnt work for early stage B2B SaaS companies If you want me to send you a breakdown of our analysis of different channels leave a comment below Great content diversity of GTM channels amazing product Startup growth on steroids Our approach proves that with the right strategy seedstage startups can achieve remarkable results in a short time,[],[],close ~$700k arr month seed stage startup startup fail stage build traction sustain long term growth traditional growth channel die startup burn cash time morale chase ghost crack code build lead gen machine deliver qualified lead day build product people want matter great marketing need want build will close deal ask right question user interview sale call feed insight directly roadmap bdr ava future product create engage content linkedin founder think leadership content secret weapon share journey win huge channel get 1000 lead investor awareness spread like wildfire completely free ava outbound engine strong flow lead generate bdr product ava depth personalization key get response lead launch huge update level week learn ava https://lnkd.in/eaj28nns tap network lead outbound product ecosystem company turn day support build outbound demand generation engine early stage founder b2b product category lead potential apply explore number gtm channel test gtm channel list seo blog content influencer press event etc learn lot work doesn't work early stage b2b saas company want send breakdown analysis different channel leave comment great content diversity gtm channel amazing product startup growth steroid approach prove right strategy seed stage startup achieve remarkable result short time,0,Evening,2139
14,"""How I spend 10 minutes a day, and generated 5 million impressions on LinkedIn in the past 5 months.""

That's what my mentor told us during our weekly community call last week. 

Before he showed us the process.

A process on how he generates lead magnets and posts that go viral.

All in less than 10 minutes.

During the call, he shared a tool that also drafts it for us.

And now you, too, can get it.

Why does it matter? Last week, I had +70.000 Impressions, which helped me gain visibility as a person on LinkedIn and share my thoughts about how AI can be used to drive business transformation and increase employee satisfaction.

Yes, it is value-driven content, branding-building, and automation - to cut through the noise and craft your positioning.

Such tools are helpful in a) saving valuable time and b) sparking discussion among people interested in the matter. 

Use the tool to:
✅ Build a detailed profile of your ideal customer.
✅ Develop a lead magnet designed to solve their specific pain points.
✅ Craft LinkedIn posts that promote the lead magnet and drive engagement. 

This system helped many of my community fellows, and myself achieve thousands of views and leads.

39,"If you don't ask, you don't get. Too many people fear rejection too much to ask for what they want. When our Google API use wasn’t approved the night before a webinar, I messaged the Google Cloud CEO on LinkedIn and the issue was solved within an hour 

Huge shoutout to Thomas Kurian and the whole Google Cloud team for this - having that level of customer centricity as a multi-trillion dollar company is wild :)

Here are a few other times this has worked for me:


1. We raised a pre-seed by sending cold LinkedIn messages when all we had was a deck and a dream

I truly never though this was going to work, but within a few weeks of starting raising, we had over $2M

2. I saw a billboard outside our office window - we had Ava's face on it within a week, and we were able to negotiate the price down by 80%

3. A couple of years ago I set up a cold email campaign to every unicorn founder asking for advice and got a 5% response rate 

The advice they gave me played into the decisions I made in the early days at Artisan 

Remember:

- The worst case scenario is somebody saying ""no""
- Not asking guarantees you won't get it

Don't fear rejection - embrace it. Treat every ""no"" you get as being one step closer to a ""yes"".",2024-10-15 17:57:37,6 months ago • Edited • Visible to anyone on or off LinkedIn,Jaspar,Carmichael-Jack,"Founder & CEO at Artisan 🦄 | Building AI Employees | Hire Ava, Our AI BDR Artisan",51,9,737,image,No,855,No,If you dont ask you dont get Too many people fear rejection too much to ask for what they want When our Google API use wasnt approved the night before a webinar I messaged the Google Cloud CEO on LinkedIn and the issue was solved within an hour Huge shoutout to Thomas Kurian and the whole Google Cloud team for this having that level of customer centricity as a multitrillion dollar company is wild Here are a few other times this has worked for me 1 We raised a preseed by sending cold LinkedIn messages when all we had was a deck and a dream I truly never though this was going to work but within a few weeks of starting raising we had over 2M 2 I saw a billboard outside our office window we had Avas face on it within a week and we were able to negotiate the price down by 80 3 A couple of years ago I set up a cold email campaign to every unicorn founder asking for advice and got a 5 response rate The advice they gave me played into the decisions I made in the early days at Artisan Remember The worst case scenario is somebody saying no Not asking guarantees you wont get it Dont fear rejection embrace it Treat every no you get as being one step closer to a yes,[],[],"ask people fear rejection ask want google api use approve night webinar message google cloud ceo linkedin issue solve hour huge shoutout thomas kurian google cloud team have level customer centricity multi dollar company wild time work

24,"Convert LinkedIn engagers to leads with this automation.
""This makes every engager a potential client. It's genius""

Everyone wants leads.

Running ads is great, but expensive 💸 
Doing SEO is great, but takes time ⌛ 
Outreach is tedious and hard 😤 

What's left?

Content creation.

Since December I've got more than 10.000 leads from posting posts like this on LinkedIn. 

However, I've had several thousand not convert to leads, but engage. 

Meaning they have some interest.

What if I could engage everyone into my outreach and funnel, and convert them to clients?

Now it's possible.

I created a guide and template you can import to set up this system yourself.

I call it the LinkedIn Reaction Scraper.

This is what the guide includes:
✅ A template for extracting LinkedIn post engagers.
✅ An automation that will automatically handle every lead.
✅ A database template you can import to save all engagers in one place.

Using this system a lot of opportunities open up.

You can build a retargeting campaign that nurtures and makes your engagers into clients. 

I'm now giving away the automation template, database template, and guide - 100% for free.

22,"A year ago, I moved to San Francisco on an O-1 Visa to build Artisan—here's the good, the bad and the ugly

At the time, we had just gotten into Y Combinator's W24 batch. On my first day in SF, my suitcase with all of my belongings was stolen from a car (the true SF welcome...) and I was living in SOMA

I learned 2 important rules after that:
1) Don't leave things in cars
2) Don't live in SOMA

Everyone talks about SF as the place to build a startup, but when I first arrived, it felt too quiet & slow - like not enough was happening

At the end of YC, despite the YC Partners' advice against moving to New York, I had told the team that we were moving the Artisan HQ there

But then, I got it. That quiet is the best thing about SF. It gives you the space to build, undisturbed, surrounded by people obsessively doing the same. No distractions, no noise—just execution

SF has a uniquely tech-forward mindset—it's the only place we could have pulled off our ""Stop Hiring Humans"" billboard campaign. It's the only place where everybody understands the startup ecosystem and AI

SF is a pretty monotonous and boring city, and that's why it's amazing. If you're building a B2B startup, there's no excuse to not be here

1,"A lot can change in a year. Last year at TechCrunch Disrupt, I was struggling to raise pre-seed funding for Artisan. This year we sponsored it 🤠

I went to TechCrunch in 2023 on a mission to raise a $2M pre-seed. Safe to say it did not work out... We were (fairly) rejected 100s of times for being too early

With all of my life savings in the company and 2 months of runway left, I was stressed to say the least

But, one call can change everything. My first call with Oliver Jung a few weeks after the conference did exactly that. He took a chance on us and wrote the first check into Artisan

A couple of weeks later we got into Y Combinator's W24 batch, and our pace has been insane ever since 

This time last year we had no product, no revenue, no team and 2 months of runway left. 

In 2024, we:
- Raised a $12M seed
- Launched 3 iterations of our AI BDR product 
- Became a market leader in AI Sales
- Closed over $1M of ARR in 30 days

We would not be where we are today without the 100s of people who have supported us on this journey - it really does take a village

23,"Artisan has just closed over $700k of ARR in 2 months. This is how I joined the founding team of a hyper-growth startup, without any relevant experience.

I spent a year applying to tech startups without getting any interviews or responses. I knew AI was a field I wanted to go into, but had no idea where to start. I only had ~1 year of experience working in PR, which would hardly make me stand out in a sea of applicants.

Here's what I did in that year, which finally landed me the CoS role at Artisan:

1. Created a list of AI startups that were fast growth, recently raised funding. I checked their job listings religiously.

2. Went to local networking events for founders and startups.

3. Checked the YC job board daily.

4. Used AI in every part of my life and read up on it constantly.

5. Reached out to people I thought were interesting on LinkedIn for coffee chats & insights into the industry.

6. Applied to every open listing that I was remotely interested in.

In December 2023, I got an interview with ElevenLabs. It was the first sign since I started my job hunt that someone was interested. The interviews went well, but as a Series A company, they were looking for someone with way more experience. I was crushed.

In January, I applied to Artisan via their careers form (artisan.co/careers), not expecting to hear back. The next day, Jaspar Carmichael-Jack messaged me to chat.

Here's what I did during the interview process that landed me the job:

1. Phrased my background to justify every step of my journey. I studied English at Oxford (talent for storytelling), went into PR (business operations interest), then moved from healthcare to tech (wanted to contribute to tech's global impact).

2. Was extremely responsive & hard working. I left Saturday plans early for a follow-up interview, spent all of Sunday on my interview task, and worked trial evenings until 12am, after my usual 9 to 5.

3. Excelled at a tough task. Because I lacked experience, I was given a mammoth task to create a website strategy for Artisan's next product launch. I had no idea where to start. GPT was my consultant through the whole process, helping me create a framework from which to work from.

4. Showed confidence in the value I COULD bring, despite my non-traditional background.

Experience shouldn't matter in hiring. Look for intelligence, resourcefulness, scrappiness - qualities for thriving in fast-paced environments. Artisan took a chance on me, which paid off through my rapid growth and dedication.

Build these qualities:
- Resourcefulness
- An insane work ethic
- Perseverance
- Confidence in your value

 and you'll catch someone's eye soon.

62,"Founders keep telling me they’re “too early” for VCs 👀 

But more often than not, it’s not the stage that’s the problem — it’s the story.

Investors don’t need millions in revenue.
We need to believe you’re the one to build something big.

When Airbnb was pitching, most investors passed.
The idea sounded niche. Couch-surfing for conferences? Really?

But they reframed it:
“People are already doing this — they’re just doing it in untrustworthy, fragmented ways. We’re building the trusted platform.”

They showed a vision that was WAY bigger than a few air mattresses.
They made the early traction feel inevitable.
They made the pain point obvious.

Suddenly, the “too early” startup became a rocketship 🚀 

Here’s the truth:
You’re not too early.
You just haven’t told a story that makes your future feel inevitable.

If you’re a founder in that zone, I want to hear your pitch.
Even if you only have 20 users.

42,"We just crossed the official 1 year anniversary of Artisan! It's been an incredible journey full of ups and downs. We're now at a crazy inflection point - we just raised a (now $12.1M) Seed, we're days away from crossing $1.5M ARR and are preparing to raise our Series A very soon - here's what I've learned:

1. SF is boring, and that's why not being here is startup su*cide

A friend once told me that SF's boringness is ""a feature not a bug"" and that stuck with me. Earlier this year I almost moved our team to New York - and while that would have been significantly more fun, it would in no way propel us towards our goal of building a generational company 

If you really care about your startup, you should be building in SF 

2. You need to make a LOT of noise

We're the newest player in the AI SDR space and probably the best known. If you want to me a market leader, you should be shouting from the rooftops and doing what you need to do to get eyeballs... some might have noticed our multiple Seed announcements ;)

3. Competition is fun

We have some very close competitors, and while a lot of people would find that intimidating, our entire team love it. There's nothing like competition to light a fire under your team to build better products, grow faster, and execute better

4. There's nothing I'd rather do

Building a company is a rollercoaster, but I genuinely believe it is one of the most rewarding and exciting things you can do. I want to be building Artisan for the next 20 years. We've got our eyes on IPO 👀

5,"After announcing our $25M Series A last week, I'm excited to share that we are launching V3 of Artisan

This release brings us closer to what outbound should be: one consolidated AI-native platform that’s intent-driven and actually effective

Most teams today juggle 5+ tools just to run basic outreach. It’s clunky and outdated. Our AI BDR Ava watches the market, identifies intent signals, and acts in real time

Here’s what’s new in V3:

Data miner - Ava scrapes 100s of sources (firmographic, technographic, intent) to pull rich lead data

Personalization waterfall - Ava dynamically identifies the best personalization on a lead level

Watchtower campaigns - Ava monitors intent signals across the internet and launches outreach the moment a lead shows buying intent (this is being rolled out with more and more triggers over the next few months)

Outbound is evolving. And we’re building the system that leads the shift

We've rented a house in SF and some of our team have now moved in together. We got a huge billboard of Ava (our AI BDR) outside our window, so she can work with us too! 

We've been flying out our remote employees for in-person sprints. 5 of our team have already come to work with us in person, and it's led to some of the most productive weeks we've had.

In the span of a few weeks, we've:
- Built our strategy for the remainder of 2024
- Started laying the groundwork for our next Artisan 👀
- Mapped out our V4 sales product roadmap
- Done an in-person engineering sprint
- Gotten closer as a team

Building culture among a remote team can be difficult, and it’s something I’m learning more about and getting better at every day. 

A few of our early learning with remote/hybrid culture have led to us doing the following:

- A weekly All Hands that reiterates our mission, aligns the team and celebrates wins 

- Developing 6 core company principles which we encourage everyone to live by, centered around how we interact with others, operate, and treat our customers

- Clearly defining our mission. Everyone on the team knows we’re building a $100bn company and redefining the broken software landscape

- Only having the best people. Our team are extraordinary talented, work hard and seek perfection. We hold that bar with new additions  

- Making Slack fun! Our Slack is full of custom emojis and key stats are sent to different channels daily. We try to keep the “office door knock” vibe by heavily using huddles

And as we rapidly grow Artisan, we're looking for insanely talented people to help us build the next paradigm of software - with consolidation and automation at the core of our mission. We're looking for passionate builders who want to pave the way for the next Industrial Revolution.

Always shoot your shot.

Because here’s what it’ll look like:

No
No
Yes
No
No
No
Yes

The worst that can happen is you get told “no.” And it might hurt your pride, but is it really that deep? No

Shooting my shot is how I:
- Raised Artisan’s pre-seed round by doing LinkedIn outreach
- Got into YC
- Hired key Artisan team members through cold outbound (including a big announcement soon 👀)
- And so many other things both in my personal and work life

Go do it. Whatever you’re hesitating about right now. Go shoot your shot. Send that message. Walk up to that person and introduce yourself. Ask for that meeting. Pitch your product. Stop waiting for things to happen and make them happen

The worst outcome is getting a no and moving on

3,"Your first 5 hires at a startup determine whether it lives or dies. Here are the first hires we made at Artisan that put us on the path to $1M ARR:

1. Engineer
2. Engineer
3. Product Manager
4. Product Designer
5. Chief of Staff

Here’s how each hire played a fundamental role in getting us from 0 to 1:

1 & 2.  Engineer:

Our first product is all-in-one outbound sales platform that consolidates 10s of tools and contains an AI BDR. We couldn’t build that with just one person – we needed more manpower

The first hires we made were engineers (one FE, one BE) and they were instrumental in building our MVP

3. Product Manager:

We’ve always been product obsessed, and every feature we create needs to be 10x better than existing solutions

To help us ensure this, we hired a PM who eventually became my co-founder, Sam!

4. Product Designer:

Most B2B software looks tired We want to create B2B SaaS that feels like using a consumer app

The UI of our MVP was terrible when we first launched it, and we realized how important it was to have a great interface so customers would actually enjoy using the product

We hired a Product Designer so we could create the best UI of any AI SDR tool on the market – and it has made a fundamental difference to our users’ experience

5. Chief of Staff:

Most startups don’t hire a CoS until post Series A. But the value you get from hiring a talented generalist that can do everything is extremely underrated

My CoS Tina was able to take full days of sales calls, create really strong content for our marketing channels & help with hiring demands and expanding our existing team

Now that we’ve hit $1M and are shifting focus to scaling existing processes, we’re looking to hire more drivers (especially engineers) to help us scale to $10M and beyond

Building the right team has enabled us to build the best AI SDR. We have the most comprehensive data, wide-reaching set of features, best personalizations, and an unparalleled user experience

31,"Artisan is one of a bevy of fast-growing startups in the highly watched AI sales development representative (AI SDR) market. It’s probably best known for its “Stop Hiring Humans” marketing campaign that has generated many news articles, social media posts, comments, and a few death threats, says the company.

When asked if he truly believes that AI will replace people, CEO Jaspar Carmichael-Jack says, “No, which is ironic, because we did the billboards that said, ‘stop hiring humans’ but that was mostly just for attention.”

“Human labor becomes more valuable when you have the AI content,” he says.

That’s not because marketing isn’t a priority. If you’ve seen our billboards or AI CEO, you know we take brand awareness very seriously...

We’ve just been deliberate about staying lean. While we’ve hired aggressively across product and engineering, marketing is the one function we’ve chosen to scale differently - all campaigns are managed by me and Tina Sang

Our marketing approach is to:
- Stick to activities which leverage our time as much as possible
- Leverage AI and automation as much as possible
- Avoid wasting time on bureaucracy
- Ruthlessly prioritize with quarterly marketing strategies
- Rely on expert freelancers for specific functions like SEO, paid, content, video, animation & much more. We couldn’t achieve what we have without them

If they keep up this pace, we’re on track to closing over $10.2m every year

With 2 more AEs starting this month & a huge product update about to drop, this number should only be skyrocketing moving forward

This close rate and deal velocity is insanely high for an early-stage startup – how are we doing it?

1. We thoroughly understand our customer base

We’ve talked to 1000s of prospects to ensure we document and understand the actual pain points sales teams face and can paint Artisan as a compelling solution 

2. We’ve built a product that buyers are desperate to use

We have by far the most advanced AI SDR on the market and teams are actively searching for solutions to their declining lead flow

We combine dozens of data sources, with the best-in-class personalization and multi-channel outreach, all in one place

Our platform’s extraordinary UI/UX is obvious on demos – we’ve put a lot of effort into building the most functional platform for sales teams, and it shows

We’ve been using Ava ourselves for lead generation, which is also why we’ve been experiencing such fast growth – we’re automating outbound, so our reps can fully focus on converting warm leads into customers

3. Our sales pipeline is fully automated

Our Strategy & Ops team have completely automated our sales pipeline, so our reps can focus on closing deals instead of doing admin

4. We generate consistent inbound leads

We generate 10s of inbound leads every day through LinkedIn, SEO, Word of Mouth, and a few other channels. If you want to see the channels we use, head to https://lnkd.in/eJHJ9yEj

64,"The “friends & family” round is a myth for most founders 😲 

No one talks enough about how hard it is to raise at the Pre-Seed and Seed stage when:

You don’t come from Stanford or Harvard
You don’t have a wealthy network
Your deck isn’t getting replies
And your traction is ""early... but promising""

Yet somehow, you're expected to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to build your MVP, grow your team, or just buy time to focus.

Here’s the truth: Fundraising at this stage isn’t just hard — it’s opaque, inefficient, and often biased toward founders with connections, not capability.

We're combating this at LvlUp Ventures.

Our mission is simple: help great founders raise capital faster — not because of who they know, but because of what they’re building.

We work with 15+ funding partners who actively invest in Pre-Seed and Seed rounds. We don’t charge founders a dime. We make warm intros, host investor events, and even help refine your materials if needed.

If you’re raising — or thinking about it — apply to our network. One app = exposure to dozens of investors.

28,"🎉 50 Deals – Not Out! 🏏

Three months and two days ago, I joined Artisan. Today, I’m proud to share that I’ve just closed my 50th deal! 🙌

Reflecting on this milestone, I wanted to share some of the strategies that have helped me achieve this:

1️⃣ Ava, our AI BDR, is a game-changer – She books in all of my meetings, saving me countless hours on outbounding, to focus on actually speaking with clients.

2️⃣ Qualification matters – I ensure every call is tailored to our clients, focusing on businesses that are serious about scaling their B2B outreach.

3️⃣ Practice makes perfect – Taking ~16 calls daily means the pitch is sharp, and the demo flows naturally.

4️⃣ Dig deep into the pain points – Understanding current processes helps me highlight how Artisan can solve their challenges and add value.

5️⃣ Follow through – Saying you’ll do something and actually doing it builds trust and credibility.

6️⃣ Relentless follow-ups – Keeping every lead informed so they can make confident decisions.

7️⃣ Smile and connect – People buy from people, and building rapport goes a long way.

8️⃣ ☕ Coffee. Lots of coffee.

This journey has been an amazing ride, and I’m excited about what’s ahead. Next stop, bringing in $1M ARR...

Hats off to the developers for building an incredible product that sells itself and to my clients for trusting me with their outreach!

6,"Over the last few weeks, I’ve had many first year MBAs reach out asking how I landed my in-semester internship at Artisan. So here’s my blueprint:

𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗯𝘆 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝘀
- Before any outreach, I asked myself: Where do I want to be in 5–7 years?
- My answer: Product x Vertical AI Agents. Even this broad vision helped me filter my search
- The path may not always be linear, and that’s okay. But try to build towards where you want to be

𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗽𝘀 𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 PitchBook
.. and apply filters that align with where you want to work
- Sector fit → I focused on AI agents
- Recent funding rounds (announced <6 months ago) → signals momentum and recruiting appetite
- Round size (>$8M) → I leaned toward Seed and Series A startups that raised enough to offer a real runway and stability

𝗦𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗲𝗱𝗜𝗻 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗹 𝗬𝗢𝗨
- Everyone says “demonstrate where you can add value.” I found that… unproductive
- Startups are chaotic! You’ll never guess what’s top of mind for them
- So I focused on what I did know: my track record and my skills

𝗔𝘃𝗼𝗶𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝗺𝗽𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗼𝗻 𝘂𝗻𝗽𝗮𝗶𝗱 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽𝘀
- I have 5+ years of experience, and I value my time
- But more than that, if your time has no defined value, you risk being handed low leverage / low value work
- Tip for founders: I never had to chat about this with Jaspar Carmichael-Jack at Artisan. He led with a solid comp package - no posturing, no games! Told me so much about how he leads

9,"In 3 years there will be no human BDRs.

Ok maybe that's slightly dramatic but there will be significantly less. The role of a BDR has become increasingly automated, but until now, no technology could fully replicate what a human can do. That’s about to change

I've chatted with 100s of BDRs who are excited about Artisan. No BDRs actually want to be BDRs - they want to build human relationships in an AE role

And companies are ready to spend less on their BDR org. For reference, Ava (our AI BDR) costs 90%+ less than the equivalent human output

Traditionally, the BDR role consists of a series of extremely manual tasks:

Build a list of contacts from a B2B data provider
Verify their contact info
Look for personalizations across their LinkedIn, X, news, etc
Prospect through channels like email, phone, or social media
Follow up
Respond to objections
Book in meetings
Update CRM

Automation has been slowly eating away at the BDR’s role for a long time and we're approaching a fully autonomous AI BDR. By 2025, AI BDRs will be list building, prospecting, qualifying over the phone, objection handling, booking meetings, taking notes, and updating CRMs autonomously

Ava already automates 80% of a BDRs role, finding leads, collecting data on from dozens of sources to effectively personalize emails and LinkedIn messages at scale, and managing deliverability

None of our prospects that receive Ava’s emails even realize she’s AI. Ava ghostwrites on behalf of humans

We recently launched our Web Visitor ID feature for Ava and some users set up campaigns with the messaging “I noticed you were on our site”

As you can imagine, that doesn’t always go down too well - it creeps people tf out

So while we definitely recommend using our person-level Web Visitor ID feature, we’d avoid telling people why you’re reaching out 🙃

60,"I had a fascinating conversation with a startup founder yesterday that got me thinking... 🤔

She asked me: ""How do you even begin to navigate the AI landscape when it changes every week & month? ""

We are barely crossing first month of 2025 and we have seen new players shaking up the AI world with DeepSeek ""wild and totally unexpected launch"", Open AI unveiled Operator, Alibaba also unveiled its AI Model Qwen and now ByteDance Doubao-1.5 pro.  

To be honest, I've been wrestling with this exact question. The pace of AI evolution is mind-bending, and staying ahead feels like trying to drink from a firehose.

But here's the thing - that's exactly why I'm excited to share something special with you.

We're hosting a webinar on ""Leveraging AI Agents For Startup Success"" with power-packed speakers from: 
1. Opening Remarks from e27 (Optimatic): Justin C.
2. Introduction on HubSpot For Startups & Sharing on HubSpot's AI Strategy & Agent.ai Marketplace 
3. Sharing from Archit Anand on Building Agentic AI & AI Strategy For Your Startup 
4. Panel Discussion on what's the hype around DeepSeek & how to navigate disruptions in AI Industries for Startups in 2025 with Khalil Nooh Peter Ong

Key Takeaways For Attendees: 
• Real-world applications of AI agents in startups 
• Practical strategies for 2025's AI landscape 
• Common pitfalls to avoid (trust me, I've seen them all!)

Let's take this journey together. Would love to see you there! 🚀

Drop a comment if you're joining us, and feel free to share what AI challenges keep you up at night. We're all in this together!

Our CS team has been working with 100s of customers using Artisan and have found that across the board, the top-performing campaigns are the ones that prioritize building a relationship with prospects, above all else

Our CSMs comes from top lead generation agencies and brings years of hands-on experience creating outbound campaigns for clients - we want to set all of our users up for the best chance of success 

And what they've found is one tactic that works really well is withholding the sell until the second or third message. Make the first message about offering the prospect something they want

A great example of this is hpy, a mental health platform designed to enhance the therapy experience. After testing a bunch of different outbound approaches, the campaign that outperformed all others was one inviting therapists to be guests on their podcast

In fact, they received so many high quality responses that they're struggling to keep up with demand!

How?

By testing 10s of different growth channels, before we landed on the best ones for Artisan.

There’s no shortcut to doing growth - it requires effort, persistence, and above everything else, time.

2. Identify the key data that represents the problem, dive into it, and create actionable reports and dashboards using SQL and Tableau/Looker.

4. Collaborate with stakeholders to execute the plan.

32,"Are AI SDRs able to replace humans yet?

At Artisan we think it'll happen soon. But what's definitely true is that your human SDRs are burning out, missing quotas, and costing you a fortune. Meanwhile, AI SDRs are working 24/7, never complaining, and delivering hot leads directly into your inbox.

Facts:
- Only 17% of human reps hit 90%+ of quota
- AI SDRs can automate 80% of outbound tasks
- They're scalable, consistent, and way cheaper than a human

Imagine your top performers freed from grunt work, focusing solely on high-value interactions. That's not the future - it's happening now. Your competition is already using AI to flood their pipeline while you're stuck in the stone age, too scared to take a risk.

It's time to adapt. Or explain to your board why you're hemorrhaging market share to companies embracing the AI revolution. The choice is yours.

✅ Clear Problem & Unique Insight
Startups that truly understand the pain point they're solving and bring a fresh, founder-led perspective to the table.

We love founders who are relentless and receptive. You're the expert in your domain—but open to strategic collaboration.

✅ Capital Efficiency
We’re big believers in doing more with less. Efficient execution and thoughtful resource allocation go a long way in this market.

47,"Hey LinkedIn fam, it's been a whirlwind journey at Fuelgrowth.ai lately, and I couldn't wait to share some insights from our founder's desk! 🚀

For the past few months, we've been heads down, laser-focused on crafting cutting-edge solution for larger enterprises. But let me tell you, the journey has been anything but ordinary. We've had countless eye-opening conversations with potential users spanning SMEs to midmarket and enterprises, and the response has been phenomenal! 🌟

Sharing some key takeaways that have been brewing in my mind:

1️⃣ Bold Conversations from Day One: Don't underestimate the power of engaging with enterprise and large organizations right from the get-go. Sometimes, the need for what you're building in these behemoths is far greater than you might anticipate. While SMEs are more accessible for conversations, it's often the big players who truly grasp the value of innovation.

2️⃣ Niche Focus, Stellar Solutions: Conversations with larger enterprises allow you to zero in on a niche and craft state-of-the-art solutions tailored to specific challenges. This focus breeds innovation and sets you apart in the market.

3️⃣ Crystal-Clear Messaging: Engaging with big players forces you to refine your messaging and positioning in the market. Being precise and clear becomes paramount, which ultimately benefits your entire brand identity.

4️⃣ Timing is Key: Navigating enterprise sales cycles, POCs, and sealing those game-changing deals alongside building your product is a marathon, not a sprint. It's crucial to tread carefully, leveraging feedback from fellow operators in the market to ensure your journey is a successful one.

Our journey at Fuelgrowth.ai is just getting started, and I'm thrilled to embark on this adventure alongside each of you. Let's keep the conversation going! 💬

84,"🚨 Startups, VCs, and the Tariff Tension: What Now? 🚨

President Trump’s newly reimposed tariffs are shaking markets, prompting a deeper question: What does this mean for startups and venture capital?

📉 The Bad News:

Nasdaq is rattled — with tech giants like NVIDIA and Tesla dropping double digits.

Klarna and StubHub postponed IPOs due to valuation pressure and uncertainty.

VCs are jittery. Theory Ventures' Tomasz Tunguz warned of a funding slowdown: “No exits = no returns = no new funds.”

📈 The (Possible) Silver Lining:

Some sectors — like #AI — are seeing more investor attention. Andreessen Horowitz is reportedly raising a $20B megafund focused on U.S. growth-stage AI.

Multinational giants like TSMC, Intel Corporation, and Samsung Electronics have committed to pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into U.S.-based fabs and advanced manufacturing, potentially creating downstream opportunities for startups in #semiconductors, #robotics, #cleantech, and #logistics.

Tariff-induced instability might spur innovation, local #manufacturing, and startup diversification — long-term positives for resilient founders.

💬 But here’s the real question: Are these tariffs a bargaining chip? Will we see them lifted or selectively reduced as leverage in future negotiations — especially with key allies and trade partners? Could this be temporary noise, or the start of a prolonged recalibration of the global startup landscape?

41,"Hello Network - any recommendations for a tool which we can use to record and translate our sales and customer success calls ? our team currently uses various sources - mobile, messaging apps, hangouts, zoom, team and others depending on clients ease of use and if we can capture them in our respective CRMs so we have more datapoints to learn and improve the productivity and results. Any recommendations will be super helpful. I came across VOIP apps but they don't solve for this use case yet. 

All founders, sales, revenue and customer success leaders how are you solving this problem in your organisation ? Would love to hear some feedback from the community.
