You're the expert in your domain—but open to strategic collaboration.\n\n✅ Capital Efficiency\nWe’re big believers in doing more with less. Efficient execution and thoughtful resource allocation go a long way in this market.\n\n✅ Platform Potential\nCan this product evolve into something bigger? We get excited by businesses with real ecosystem or category-defining potential.\n\nOur team rolls up its sleeves post-investment—we don’t just write checks, we help you grow through partnerships, channel support, and deep founder-in-residence experience.\n\nIf you're building something bold, we’d love to hear from you.\n\n🔗 Apply Now: https://lnkd.in/ee9zRHJE\n\n#LvlUpVentures #SeedStage #Startups #VC #FounderJourney #VentureCapital #EarlyStageInvesting #VentureCapital #TechStartups #CPG #SaaS #PitchUs",

It’s different for gluten-free, however, since many consumers lack local #GlutenFreeBeer options. \n\nEver since we launched, we would receive emails from consumers asking us if we could ship our beer to them out of state. It’s been about 18 months since we started national eCommerce, and the reception has been explosive. With Shopline and LvlUp, we look forward to “leveling up” and extending this hockey stick growth to even greater heights.",

  "text": "🚀 Why 2025 Might Be the Best Time in a Decade to Build a CPG Brand\n\nWith all the talk about rising costs, tighter capital, and DTC struggles—it might seem like the odds are stacked against emerging CPG brands. But under the surface, there's something exciting happening:\n\n🔹 Retail buyers are hungry for innovative indie products that build loyalty and drive growth in a saturated aisle.\n🔹 Strategic acquirers are back—2024 saw a ~20% YoY increase in M&A activity in food & beverage, especially in better-for-you and premium segments.\n🔹 Community-led brands are thriving on platforms like TikTok, where 67% of Gen Z say they discover new CPG products.\n🔹 Capital is still flowing, but it’s flowing smarter—investors are favoring capital-efficient operators with strong gross margins and clear paths to profitability.\n\n💡 If you’re a founder building with a focus on retail strategy, product velocity, and community, you might be more “VC-backable” than you think.\nApply for Funding from the LvlUp Ventures CPG Fund: https://lnkd.in/gwh3vHaQ\n\n💼 And if you’re an investor, this is the perfect moment to back brands that blend great storytelling with margin discipline and omni-channel savvy.\nJoin the LvlUp Ventures Investor Network: https://lnkd.in/gP_Xw7Ei\n\n✨ The CPG playbook has changed—but for those who adapt, it might just be the best time to build.\n\n#CPG #VentureCapital #ConsumerBrands #Startups #Retail #Ecommerce #BrandBuilding #VC #Startup #Consumer #DTC",

  "text": "🚨 Startups, VCs, and the Tariff Tension: What Now? 🚨\n\nPresident Trump’s newly reimposed tariffs are shaking markets, prompting a deeper question: What does this mean for startups and venture capital?\n\n📉 The Bad News:\n\nNasdaq is rattled — with tech giants like NVIDIA and Tesla dropping double digits.\n\nKlarna and StubHub postponed IPOs due to valuation pressure and uncertainty.\n\nVCs are jittery. Theory Ventures' Tomasz Tunguz warned of a funding slowdown: “No exits = no returns = no new funds.”\n\n📈 The (Possible) Silver Lining:\n\nSome sectors — like #AI — are seeing more investor attention. Andreessen Horowitz is reportedly raising a $20B megafund focused on U.S. growth-stage AI.\n\nMultinational giants like TSMC, Intel Corporation, and Samsung Electronics have committed to pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into U.S.-based fabs and advanced manufacturing, potentially creating downstream opportunities for startups in #semiconductors, #robotics, #cleantech, and #logistics.\n\nTariff-induced instability might spur innovation, local #manufacturing, and startup diversification — long-term positives for resilient founders.\n\n💬 But here’s the real question: Are these tariffs a bargaining chip? Will we see them lifted or selectively reduced as leverage in future negotiations — especially with key allies and trade partners? Could this be temporary noise, or the start of a prolonged recalibration of the global startup landscape?\n\n#startups #venturecapital #trump #tariffs #IPO #VCfunding #AI #a16z #economy #innovation #vc #startup",

  "text": "Founders keep telling me they’re “too early” for VCs 👀 \n\nBut more often than not, it’s not the stage that’s the problem — it’s the story.\n\nInvestors don’t need millions in revenue.\nWe need to believe you’re the one to build something big.\n\nWhen Airbnb was pitching, most investors passed.\nThe idea sounded niche. Couch-surfing for conferences? Really?\n\nBut they reframed it:\n“People are already doing this — they’re just doing it in untrustworthy, fragmented ways. We’re building the trusted platform.”\n\nThey showed a vision that was WAY bigger than a few air mattresses.\nThey made the early traction feel inevitable.\nThey made the pain point obvious.\n\nSuddenly, the “too early” startup became a rocketship 🚀 \n\nHere’s the truth:\nYou’re not too early.\nYou just haven’t told a story that makes your future feel inevitable.\n\nIf you’re a founder in that zone, I want to hear your pitch.\nEven if you only have 20 users.\n\n👇  Apply Here (We Meet With Every Founder) 👇 \n🔗 https://lnkd.in/e3tnQh9G\n\n#Startups #Founders #SeedStage #VentureCapital #PitchTips #VC #StartupStory #EarlyStageStartups #AngelInvesting #TechStartups",

  "text": "The future of AI and National Artificial Intelligence Association members’ influence on it:\n\nIn my view, Artificial Intelligence is an almost limitless technology which, within the next three to five years will have the ability to entirely revolutionize the way we live and work. \n\nThis is already proving to be the case, with large enterprises instituting hiring freezes on new talent due to the efficiencies of AI, and startups in our LvlUp Ventures portfolio creating entire platforms in days with zero software developers.\n\nWithin the next three years, I believe that AI will put us at an inflection point including such questions as: do we let AI have the capability to soon replace the majority of the workforce? Do we allow AI access sensitive to data for medical treatment development? Do we permit AI to deeply assist in war fighting?\n\nPeople & governments around the world will be faced with the need to make decisions including on the issues above.\n\nCurrently, the Trump administration is rightfully advocating for strong investment & development in AI. That is largely due to the promise it contains for global competitiveness and the American economy. In just a couple of years, that will likely be a very different situation, as AI advancements will set the stage for the loss of potential jobs, cyber & biological threats, and more.\n\nThe National Artificial Intelligence Association, quickly becoming one of the largest technology coalitions in the country, is primed to ensure that the American people, government, and the world at large are able to make the right decisions before, during, and after these times in order to unleash American ingenuity and decide on what the “fine line” is for Artificial Intellifence and its impact on society: limited or limitless integration; work or home; unfettered growth; or an entirely different approach.\n\n#AI #technology #regulation #US #Globe",

The Biden Administration also released a 165-page \"Interim Final Rule on AI diffusion\".  (See separate post on the Rule).  The recent \"NAIA Digest: AI in Washington\" relayed of this upcoming, last minute Biden Administration AI plans to limit AI chip exports while enhancing the USA's computing capacity.\n\nSome policies of note in this Executive Order and be aware since this is not a Congressional passed law, President Trump's Administration can reverse all or parts of the EO.\n\nThis Executive Order will direct the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy to lease federal sites where the private sector can build frontier AI infrastructure at speed and scale.... Some of this new capacity will also be committed for use by small businesses and startups. Emphasis on clean energy production, accelerate approvals, and no impact on consumer electricity costs.\n\nMore details on the AI industry reaction in the next NAIA Digest.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/g4y9mZfW",
